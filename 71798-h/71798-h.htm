<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Speech is one of God’s greatest gifts to man, yet, comparatively
speaking, how few there are whose speech is pleasing
to hear, clear and understandable, impressive and stimulative
to action.</p>

<p>From the cradle to the grave every person, perforce, uses
speech, just as he eats, breathes, drinks, sleeps. It is one of
the important, ever exercised functions of life. Upon it all
our social, business and professional intercourse is based.
Without it, life as we know it, would be impossible. With it,
developed to its natural, normal, proper, and readily attainable
efficiency, there are few limits to what man may aspire
to attain.</p>

<p>Recognizing to the full the truth of the aphorism that “the
things we enjoy doing are the things we do best,” it is the
purpose of this book so to present its subject as to create in
its readers a firm resolve to so thoroughly enjoy good reading
that they will do it well.</p>

<p>The aim is twofold: <i>first</i>, to stimulate a natural desire on
the part of the student for the proper use of voice and body
in the oral interpretation of literature; and <i>second</i>, to present
a natural and practical scheme for the attainment of this end.</p>

<p>After a number of years of experience and observation the
authors have come to believe that when even the most diffident
pupil has once had aroused in him a real <i>enjoyment</i> in the
acts of speaking and reading aloud, he is destined to become
not only an intelligent, but an intelligible reader.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to argue for the recognition of
vocal expression as a worthy and definite part of the curriculum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of High School and College. Training in the spoken
word is to-day, as never before, looked upon as a prerequisite
to professional and business success. Henry Ward Beecher,
speaking of the rightful place of speech culture, says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A living force that brings to itself all the resources of the imagination,
all the inspirations of feeling, all that is influential in body, in
voice, in eye, in gesture, in posture, in the whole animated man, is in
strict analogy with the divine thought and the divine arrangement ...
and so regarded, it should take its place among the highest departments
of education.</p>

</div>

<p>The majority of mankind, however, seems to feel that beautiful,
powerful, and effective speech or the ability to read well
and acceptably is the gift or attainment of the chosen few.
Nothing can be further from the fact. Beauty is the normal
condition in the universe in every realm of nature, and is
attained by the simple effort of each thing to express itself
in natural and spontaneous fashion. Likewise, clear, impressive,
delight-giving, thought-provoking speech, and the power
to read well are as easy to attain, and may be obtained in the
same natural, spontaneous, unaffected manner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the past the teachers of these simple and
natural arts befogged the whole subject by their artificialities,
formalities, conventionalities and pretenses. Their text-books
were filled with unnecessary and injurious rules, mandates, and
requirements. And thus the pseudo-science of “Elocution,”
with its stilted expressions, its fixed gestures, its artificial inflections,
came into being. And the students who were eager
to acquire the mastery of effective speech,—than which there
is no greater accomplishment,—were intimidated, frightened
away by the multiplicity of rules and theories.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful that the day is dawning when instruction
in correct spoken language comes through the easy avenues of
naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity and normal enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
Too long have we been discouraged by the glib aphorism that
there is no easy road to learning. It is not true, if by learning
we mean the attainment of the real intellectual things, instead
of the sham, pretentious things that men in the past too often
have called learning.</p>

<p>The authors of this book venture the affirmation that hardly
one of the great readers, public speakers of power, or orators
of influence have ever taken a lesson in the so-called art of
“elocution” or heeded any of its straight-jacket rules. Daniel
Webster has well expressed the difference between the man
with a heart full of burning thoughts demanding utterance,
and the one with a mouth full of carefully chosen words, and
exquisitely modulated phrases, meaning little or nothing to the
soul of him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>True eloquence, indeed, does not consist in speech. It cannot be
brought from afar. Labor and learning may toil for it, but they will
toil in vain. Words and phrases may be marshaled in every way, but
they cannot compass it. <i>It must exist in the man, in the subject, and
in the occasion. Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of
declamation, all may aspire after it,—they cannot reach it. It comes,
if it comes at all, like the outbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or
the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native
force. The graces taught in the schools, the costly ornaments and
studied contrivances of speech, shock and disgust men, when their own
lives, and the fate of their wives, their children, and their country hang
on the decision of the hour.</i> Then words have lost their power, rhetoric
is in vain, and all elaborate oratory contemptible. Even genius
itself then feels rebuked and subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities.
Then patriotism is eloquent; then self-devotion is eloquent.
The clear conception, out-running the deductions of logic, the high
purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue,
beaming from the eye, informing every feature, and urging the whole
man onward, right onward to his object,—this, this is eloquence; or,
rather, it is something greater and higher than all eloquence: it is
action,—noble, sublime, God-like action.</p>

</div>

<p>The natively-eloquent learned to speak with power because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
they had a message, because they felt, were deeply moved,
saw a vision, experienced a deep emotion, had a thought they
strongly desired to communicate to others, and with a few
fundamental, simple, readily-grasped principles before them,
generally unconsciously exercised, they said their say, and convinced
the world.</p>

<p>To state these basic principles with the simplicity and naturalness
they call for, and to show the pleasure and power that
come from their development is the purpose of the authors of
this book.</p>

<p>By following these self-evident steps one who has something
worth saying, whose heart is deeply stirred, will become
a good reader, a fluent, convincing public speaker with little or
no conscious effort. Just as a few simple exercises, regularly
persisted in, produce glowing, radiant health and physical
strength, so will these simple, enjoyable exercises, kept ever
in mind and daily used, bring to one the glowing delight of
reading to oneself with appreciation and intelligence, reading
publicly with intelligibility and effectiveness, and speaking to
a large or small audience with convincing power.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Selections of the Book</span></h3>

<p>While there are many and varied text-books that deal with
this important subject in a more or less modern fashion, they
all use, to a greater or lesser extent, the same old selections
from well-known authors and orators, which, unfortunately,
were used by the teachers of the stilted, artificial, sophomoric
and altogether discredited “elocution.” Hence, the authors
and editors of this volume have made an <i>almost entirely new
choice</i> of Selections for illustrative purposes and for public
reading. But few will be found that have been used elsewhere.
References are made to the writings of standard authors
which may be obtained in any ordinary library, but a
large percentage of the prose and poetry of this collection is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
taken from the more modern and popular American writers.</p>

<p>It is neither the intent nor the desire of the editors to limit
the field of thought of their readers or students to any one
field of English literature. Our aim is quite the contrary.
We would so emphasize the worth of the literature of the
West, however, that those who have hitherto deemed that “no
good can come out of Nazareth,” may be led to search for literary
good in other Nazareths.</p>

<p>Literature is as wide as civilized human life, and according
to the intensity with which life is lived, and the desire of those
who live to express that intensity, will literature of strength
and power be produced. The West lives intensely, rapidly,
urgently, individually, hence its literature is intense, strong
and powerful.</p>

<p>Just as sure as history records the existence of an early
West—a West where the gun and knife settled men’s heated
controversies, a West where, for many years, there was a
dearth of woman’s soft voice and tender smile—just so sure
are the writings of the Western poets, philosophers and storytellers
of this period a vital part of our early American literature.
The literature of the West, as with the literature of
any country, needs only be a true, sincere, worthy expression
of the life it professes to portray.</p>

<p>The greater one’s knowledge of the literatures of the various
peoples of the world, the deeper one’s sympathies become, and
the easier it is to grasp the divine principles of human brotherhood.</p>

<p>The authors also wish to call attention to what they deem
another important feature of their work. It will be seen from
the outline plan of the book that it is divided into four parts,
viz.: Intelligible Reading, Sympathetic Reading, Melodious
Reading, Oratorical Reading.</p>

<p>The selections have been arranged, in the main, under these
respective headings, that they may accompany the explanations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
serve to elucidate the principles laid down, and afford
copious examples for their practice.</p>

<p>There is also an important and practical chapter on the
Development and Use of the Memory.</p>

<p>That this book will fill a long felt and continuously expressed
want on the part of teachers of Oral Reading is the
confident assurance of the editors.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the technical part of the book the
authors have been immeasurably aided by their large and personal
knowledge of, and acquaintance or friendship with, leading
orators in politics, the law, the church, on the lecture platform,
and at public dinners and other functions. They have
also availed themselves of the same knowledge of the great
interpreters in the theater. A long, intimate study of the
essential characteristics which made for the success of many
masters in the art of using the spoken word has been made.
Thus the authors are assured that no factor that leads towards,
and assures, success in dramatic or private reading or speaking
has been ignored. All academic and purely theoretical
matter has been rigorously excluded.</p>

<p>The old methods of sophomoric oratory are gone, never to
return. Men and women of purpose have learned that simplicity,
directness, naturalness, are the most potent factors in
conveying their ideas to others. It is gratifying to know that
modern methods of teaching Oral Reading and Private and
Public Speaking seek to emphasize these fundamental principles
and reduce to the lowest possible minimum all introductions
of the artificial.</p>

<span class="smaller">READING AND PUBLIC SPEECH</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It is the first and last object of education “to teach people
how to think.” When we consider the vast wealth of great
thoughts felt and expressed by great men of all times and
recorded for us in books, should we not give serious reflection
upon <i>what</i> we read and <i>how</i> we read?</p>

<p>This book has to do primarily with how rightly to <i>speak</i>
thoughts and feelings hidden in great literature—yet it is
strictly in keeping with this purpose to give some attention to
<i>silent</i> reading as distinguished from <i>oral</i> reading. For how
can one hope to become an <i>intelligible</i> reader who is not first
an <i>intelligent</i> one? This does not argue that an intelligent
reader is likewise intelligible, for the mere comprehension of
the author’s thought and mood does not in itself insure a
proper or adequate oral rendition of the same. In this sense
we think of the former act as a necessity, and of the latter
as an accomplishment.</p>

<p>Yet in this twentieth century we can hardly make the above
limitations, for he who is to become most useful to himself
and to others, must not only be able to understand what he
reads, but must, at the same time, be able effectively to communicate
it to others. The latter accomplishment, of course,
necessitates systematic drill and practice, and the greater portion
of this book is devoted to a series of lessons for carrying
on such a course of instruction. In this immediate chapter,
however, we are concerned more particularly with reading in
general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>One of the first steps toward fitting oneself to become an
impressive reader and speaker is to acquire a real love for the
best literature. The only way to do this is by making the
acquaintance of great authors, and the best way to come into
companionship with noble writers is conscientiously to study
their works. Because, at first glance, an author may seem
obscure, too many are fain to put the book aside, or substitute
for it one that does not require any effort to enjoy. But, after
all, is it not the books over which we struggle most that yield
us the most joy and the most good? When once we form the
friendship of great books and catch their vision, we cannot
help but pattern our lives, in a very large measure, in accordance
with those fundamental and lasting principles of right living
and right thinking which characterize the writings of all
great men and women. Their ideals become our ideals.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that if we hope to become agreeable
speakers or conversationalists we must, at the outset, realize it
as imperative that we, make ourselves familiar with the writings,
in verse and prose, of noble minds. It is by this close
association with great people, who have not only understood
and felt the deeper meanings of life, but who have put their
experiences and knowledge into permanent literature, that we
may have our smaller souls kindled to glow brighter and
longer. It is by giving an attentive ear to the voices that call
to us from our bookshelves that our finer sensibilities are
quickened to fuller appreciation of nature, of art, and of the
joy of living.</p>

<p>We must realize that training in the development of oral
expression is primarily a cultural course, but, at the same time,
a practical one. Many people would invert the order of this
statement, but all are agreed that correct vocal expression aids
immeasurably in the development of taste and refinement, and,
at the same time, affords, in many ways, practical assistance
in daily living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>Pure water is more likely to be drawn from a deep well than
from a shallow pool. So, also, he who possesses depth of
feeling and appreciation of noble thoughts and pure emotions
is more likely to give adequate and satisfactory oral expression
to them than he whose feeling is shallow and indifferent.
Experience teaches that nothing gives greater aid to a spontaneous,
irresistible flow of thought, revealing, through voice
and body, the finer conceptions of the human soul, than a constant
familiarity with the deep wells of the best literature.</p>

<p>By listening eagerly to the best words great men of all times
have said to the world, we make our own natures responsive.
Then, in greater or lesser measure, as readers or speakers, we
translate or interpret these words for the enjoyment or uplift
of others.</p>

<p>How can the man, the woman, of limited time and means,
proceed so as to find these treasures of literature?</p>

<p>Let us here set down, briefly and clearly, what seems to us
the most enjoyable and natural method to use. In the first
place, ask yourself if you are willing to be a hard worker,
self-sacrificing and humble. Unless you are, you will find that
great spirits are slow to share with you their richest treasures.
You must first make yourself worthy before you can expect
to enter into their <i>sanctum</i>. In the words of Ruskin:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You must be willing to work hard to find the hidden meaning of the
author. Ask yourself, “Am I inclined to work as an Australian miner
would? Are my pick-axes and shovels in good order, and am I in
good trim myself, my sleeves well up to my elbows, and my breath
good, and my temper?” ... The metal you are in search of being
the author’s mind or meaning, his words are as the rock which you
have to crush and smelt in order to get at it. And your pick-axes are
your own care, wit, and learning; your smelting furnace is your own
thoughtful soul. Do not hope to get at any good author’s meaning
without those tools and that fire; often you will need sharpest, finest
chiseling, and patientest fusing, before you can gather one grain of
the metal.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Then, too, you must be patient. An untrained reader is,
as it were, wandering in a great forest where he sees many
paths, but he knows not which to take. If he pursue a wrong
path the first, second or the third time, he should not lose hope,
but seek again and again. By such experiences he is sharpening
his faculty of discrimination, and erelong can, in a brief
space, detect which paths he should follow. No one but yourself
can prescribe rightly a course of reading best suited to
your particular needs. It must be a voluntary search on your
own part, and an enjoyable one, if you are to get the most
from it.</p>

<p>But here enters a serious consideration: Is what I enjoy
most the best for me? The answer is Yes and No! Yes,
if you enjoy most what appeals to the best in you; no, if you
enjoy most what in your heart you know appeals to what is
the worst in you. Therefore, the important question for you
to answer is—does this book, article, essay or poem merely
interest me, or does it appeal to the best in me?</p>

<p>Henry Van Dyke expresses the matter perfectly:</p>

<p>The person who wants to grow, turns to books as a means of purifying
his tastes, deepening his feelings, broadening his sympathies, and
enhancing his joy of life. Literature he loves because it is the most
humane of the arts. Its forms and processes interest him as expressions
of the human striving towards clearness of thought, purity of
emotion, and harmony of action with the ideal. The culture of a
finer, fuller manhood is what this reader seeks. He is looking for
the books in which the inner meanings of nature and life are translated
into language of distinction and charm, touched with the human
personality of the author, and embodied in forms of permanent interest
and power. This is literature. And the reader who sets his affections
on these things enters the world of books as one made free of a
city of wonders, a garden of fair delights. He reads not from a
sense of duty, not from a constraint of fashion, not from an ambition
of learning, but from a thirst of pleasure; because he feels that pleasure
of the highest kind,—a real joy in the perception of things lucid, luminous,
symmetrical, musical, sincere, passionate, and profound,—such pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
restores the heart and quickens it, makes it stronger to endure the
ills of life and more fertile in all good fruits of cheerfulness, courage
and love. This reader for vital pleasure has less need of maps and
directories, rules and instructions, than of companionship. A criticism
that will go with him in his reading, and open up new meaning
in familiar things, and touch the secrets of beauty and power, and
reveal the hidden relations of literature to life, and help him to see
the reasonableness of every true grace of style, the sincerity of every
real force of passion,—a criticism that penetrates, illuminates, and
appreciates, making the eyes clearer and the heart more sensitive to
perceive the living spirit in good books,—that is the companionship
which will be most helpful, and most grateful to the gentle reader.</p>

<span class="smaller">EFFECTIVE SPEECH</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There are four definite steps in the mastery of effective
speech:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must be <span class="smcap">Intelligible</span></li>
<li>It must be <span class="smcap">Sympathetic</span></li>
<li>It must be <span class="smcap">Melodious</span></li>
<li>It must be <span class="smcap">Forceful</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In seeking to accomplish these four aims, the pupil will not
only increase his culture but his practical mental power as well.</p>

<p>The first step has to do with whatever makes understandable
what he has to say. But before he can be <i>intelligible</i> in address,
he must be an <i>intelligent</i> reader. He must train himself
to master the real meaning of words. This means taking in—comprehending—and
translating the thought of others. This
is an important part in accomplishing the first step. The mind
must be trained quickly and accurately to comprehend the
printed page.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Basis for Good Oral Reading</span></h4>

<p>Grasp this idea firmly: Before one may hope to read <i>intelligibly</i>,
he must first be an <i>intelligent</i> reader. You cannot
express outwardly what you have not received and do not feel
inwardly. Therefore the basis of good oral reading is understanding—intelligent
silent reading. Some one has well said,
“Unless a child can read, he cannot be educated.” How few
can read at sight a short passage and then close the book and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
relate its context. Why is this the case? Because the pupil
has not been properly trained to read.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Basis for Good Silent Reading</span></h4>

<p>In the study of the printed word we must remember that its
real meaning depends altogether upon its relation to other
words in the same group. For instance, the word “fire” does
not mean the same thing at all times. The real meaning of
this word depends upon its kinship with other members of the
same group. When we say, “The house is on fire,” the word
“fire” means an altogether different thing from what it means
when we say, “There is need of a fire in the stove this morning.”
We must continually take care that we do not isolate
words, but that we get their <i>associated</i> meaning. For too
long a time in our public schools the pupils have been taught
to read <i>words</i> and not <i>ideas</i> or <i>thoughts</i>. They have been
taught to read word by word and not group by group. For
instance, the most elementary pupils will read as follows:
“The—cat—can—run—and—play—with—the—ball.” The
grouping is altogether overlooked. The children are concentrating
their attention upon single or isolated <i>words</i> instead of
upon <i>thought groups</i> made up of several words as follows:
“The cat can run—and play with the ball.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Get the Author’s Thought</span></h4>

<p>Whatever one reads, he must first determine for what purpose
he is reading. A definite aim or end in view must be
had to serve as a motive power. The pupil who can relate
the successive events in a narrative after having read it carefully,
has trained his memory. But memory training is not
the highest aim or end. The thing of paramount importance
is: What is the application of the author’s meaning? The
value lies in what <i>use</i> the student can make of the knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
This act of getting the author’s thought draws upon the student’s
stock of experience. All new matter comes to the
pupil in terms of his past experiences. The task of the teacher
is to aid him in identifying himself with the lesson taught by
the author, so that he can make practical use of it.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">We Are Not Studying Style</span></h4>

<p>In this present step in the development of the student in
effective speech the style of an author is nothing more than a
means to an end and not the end itself. The test for the pupil
is to see if he can put in his own words the vital meaning of
the author. It should not be his purpose to attempt to improve
on the writer’s style. It is true that some of the world’s
greatest literary expressions would lose their highest significance
if put in any other than their original form. This applies
especially to verse form, for here the rhythmic movement
is an inseparable element in the full expression of the
idea. Some one has well said: “Style grows to the thought
as the sea-shell to its occupant.” But at this point the aim
is not to teach the pupil the mechanics of literature. He must
be taught to think for himself and use the knowledge he
gains so that it will be valuable in his own life.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Three Definite Aims to Gain Knowledge</span></h4>

<p>Let us keep in mind the fact that the pupil is continually
seeking information which will help him to live better. He
is constantly trying to increase his cultural and practical powers.
Of course book learning does not furnish all, but its contribution
is immeasurable in its importance. Hence the pupil
must learn to master the printed word as well as the spoken
word. Here are three definite ends or aims to serve as motive
power in getting the thought of the author:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>First, the student must seek ideas and not words.</p>

<p>Second, he must seek to classify and organize facts.</p>

<p>Third, he must seek to turn his knowledge to some use.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Each Aim Illustrated</span></h4>

<p>To illustrate the first aim, let us take the following lines
from Hamlet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">Give me that man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In my heart’s core, aye, in my heart of hearts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I do thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare wished to point out the blessedness of that virtue,
Independence. It is of little consequence to the pupil in
this first step of his growth to make a comparison between
Shakespeare’s method of expressing this truth, with that of
Elbert Hubbard, who, speaking of Rowan, that man who delivered
an important message to Garcia in the jungles of Cuba
when we had decided to go to war with Spain, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By the Eternal! there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless
bronze and the statue placed in every college of the land. It is
not book-learning young men need, nor instructions about this and that,
but a stiffening of the vertebræ which will cause them to be loyal to a
trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies; do the thing—Carry
a message to Garcia!</p>

</div>

<p>Is not the aim in both cases for the pupil to get the idea
which the authors wish to impress upon his mind? In other
words, the authors are not simply writing for art’s sake, as
so many would have us believe. The pupil must get the author’s
messages, so that they will help him in life, to be both
independent or free from passion, and reliable or dependable
in whatever he undertakes.</p>

<p>Let us advance to the second step: The classification and
organization of facts mean more than the simple process of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
orderly arrangement. This has to do with translating what
the author presents to the pupil in terms of his past experience.
This is the process of judging values. Before we pigeon-hole
new information, we pass judgment upon its relative importance.
The pupil has experienced the value of punctuality,
courage, optimism, etc. Now, when any new truth comes under
his observation, it is not turned into knowledge until it
has gone through his mental gristmill. What he hears, or
sees, or feels, is not usable until it has been fitted into its particular
niche, and this fitting process is brought about by likening
the unknown to the known.</p>

<p>This brings us to the third step. Frederick Harrison has
said: “Man’s business here is to know for the sake of living,
not to live for the sake of knowing.” There is no better
way of expressing the third step in the development of the student
in intelligent reading. After he has learned to grasp the
author’s thought readily, and then so reacts upon it that it becomes
a part of his very being, his next step is to find an open
market for the sale of his knowledge. This does not mean
to sell for money in the narrow sense, but to put his understanding
into actual daily life.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="smaller">INVENTORY OF SPEECH EFFICIENCY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Before proceeding further, let us estimate our speech efficiency.
Every conscientious person can determine the strong
and weak points of his speech by asking himself a few questions.
Some, more sensitive than others, will very likely magnify
their weaknesses and minimize their commendable qualities.
Be that as it may, the vast majority will give a fair
rating to both good and bad vocal habits.</p>

<p>This personal consultation with yourself may take a long or
a short time. Some are quick to see faults in themselves—and
probably slow to correct them; still others are slow to see
their own errors and probably never will correct them; but
all careful and honest students will discover at once where
they are lacking in the proper management of voice, and will
proceed to overcome their difficulties.</p>

<p>In rating speech efficiency it is well to make use of the common
questionnaire plan. The questions fall under two separate
heads, namely, the Knowing and the Doing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Knowing</span></h4>

<p class="hanging">1. Do I realize that I use my voice almost constantly?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Do I realize that success in business or society depends
largely upon the convincing power of speech?</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Do I realize how much of my speech is of no avail?</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Do I realize the vital importance of <i>inflection</i> and the
influence it has upon those who hear me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">5. Do I realize the great delight that comes through the
mastery of correct vocal usage?</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Do I realize that it is unnecessary to have a tired throat
at the end of the day?</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Do I realize that in a very large degree a pleasing personality
depends upon a pleasing voice?</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Do I realize that by attaining convincing power of speech
I am promoting my efficiency?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Doing</span></h4>

<p class="hanging">1. Do I talk more than is necessary?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Do I pitch my voice too high?</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Do I speak with a tense, set jaw and use a hard, metallic
tone?</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Do I talk in my throat instead of in my mouth?</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Do I continually talk on the same key?</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Do I talk too fast, or too slow, or too loud, or too low?</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Do I use my voice as a medium by which I give vent to
anger or displeasure?</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Do I speak quietly and softly, and thus indicate culture
and refinement?</p>

<p class="hanging">9. Do I speak loudly in order to be persuasive?</p>

<p class="hanging">10. Do I attract undue attention to my speech?</p>

<p class="hanging">11. Do I enunciate with clearness and precision?</p>

<p class="hanging">12. Do I harmonize tone with mood?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>More items could be placed under these two headings, but
the above are sufficient to bring the student face to face with
his speech difficulties. We must know wherein we lack
speech efficiency before we can remedy the lack. The following
chapters present adequate exercises for needed improvement.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smaller">ORAL READING</span></h3>

</div>

<p>If the pupil is to enjoy logical and consistent development
in expression, he must be taught along psychological lines.
Teachers should never lose sight of the fact that what is good
for one pupil is not always good for another. It is impossible
to set down a set of rules which will govern alike all
pupils. Only that teacher is worthy of the name who recognizes
that every pupil presents more or less a separate problem.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Teacher’s First Great Task</span></h4>

<p>The teacher’s first important task is to render the pupil
rightly disposed. Some pupils are at once extremely anxious
to be governed by the wisdom of their teachers, while others
are skeptical and must serve an apprenticeship in imitation.
Still others are perverse and must be coerced. It is the patient
and long-suffering teacher whose highest hopes will be
realized.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">What Is Expression?</span></h4>

<p>What is expression? We are told that all life is expression:
The sudden summer shower, the leap of the wild cataract, the
springing forth of early flowers, and the slow motion of the
glacier all represent Nature expressing herself. The musician
over the keyboard, the painter at his easel, the writer at
his desk, represent art expressing herself. This is all true.
But what about mankind as a whole, what about the vast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
majority of people who are not endowed with genius? Have
they no universal and common mode of expression?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Greatest Educational Value</span></h4>

<p>Here lies the great educational value of oral reading, of
expressive speech. Their appeal should be universal and not
confined to a talented few. It were better that those who
have native ability were wholly neglected and allowed to express
themselves in their own way, than that the vast majority
have no training at all. It is the ungifted who should be aided
rather than those who have been especially endowed by
Nature.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Desire to Express</span></h4>

<p>The desire to express is common to all humanity from infancy
to old age. The true aim of education should be to
“draw out” that which is within us; in other words, to express
ourselves—physically, mentally and spiritually. The world’s
great personalities are those who have the greatest freedom of
expression. They have mastered the power to reveal their
inmost selves. They have profited by the truth that through
exercise we grow. So we should continually aim to free those
channels through which we communicate ourselves to the outside
world, in order that our highest faculties be unshackled
and be given perfect freedom.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Channels of Expression</span></h4>

<p>Let us consider briefly what are the chief avenues or channels
of revealing what we are to others. Our first means is
by movements of a part or all of the body. This we call the
Physical Channel. Later in the development of man the location
of sound in the throat was made. Man noted that when
he experienced a certain mood, unconsciously he gave vent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
a corresponding guttural noise or sound. This is called the
Sound or Tone Channel. Lastly, man invented sound symbols—words.
That is, certain vocal sounds represented certain
objects and ideas. This we call the Word Channel.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Merging of the Channels</span></h4>

<p>To sum up, we have three separate ways by which we can
express what we think and feel. It is very important that the
pupil, as well as the teacher, keep this fact in mind. If we
are to be natural and successful in giving out what we really
are, these three means must coördinate, must act harmoniously.
That is, the body, or Physical Channel, must parallel the Word
Channel, and the Tone Channel must parallel the Physical and
Word Channel. Each must bear witness to the truth uttered
by the other. When the fullness of each, freighted with human
meaning, overflows, there is a merging of all three. The
result is natural and intense expression. Our supreme purpose
is to realize this triune of man’s expressive powers.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="smaller">SELECTIONS FOR PART ONE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The preceding discussions should be kept in mind while
studying the following selections. The primary purpose is to
seek after the author’s thought. If we are able to relate
clearly and fluently in our own words the content of what we
have read, then we can feel assured that we have found out
the meaning of the author.</p>

<p>First: Read the selection paragraph by paragraph. Then
arrange in your mind the several points in their respective
order. Now give them orally as simply and progressively as
possible.</p>

<p>Second: Read the selection again by paragraphs and this
time determine what are the important and unimportant words.
Then give these important words a greater force of utterance.</p>

<p>Third: Do not fear to make many groups. We must first
see the author’s ideas and pictures in broken bits. When we
have thought clearly on each part of the whole, and have each
part securely in mind, we can then surely and effectively put
these separate parts into one complete picture.</p>

<h4>THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Muir</span></p>

<p>Go where you will throughout the noble woods of the Sierra Nevada,
among the giant pines and spruces of the lower zones, up through the
towering Silver Firs to the storm-bent thickets of the summit peaks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
you everywhere find this little squirrel the master-existence. Though
only a few inches long, so intense is his fiery vigor and restlessness,
he stirs every grove with wild life, and makes himself more important
than even the huge bears that shuffle through the tangled underbrush
beneath him. Every wind is fretted by his voice, almost every bole
and branch feel the sting of his sharp feet. How much the growth
of the trees is stimulated by his means it is not easy to learn, but his
action in manipulating their seeds is more appreciable. Nature has
made him master forester and committed most of her coniferous crops
to his paws. Probably over fifty per cent of all the cones ripened on
the Sierra are cut off and handled by the Douglas alone, and of those
of the Big Trees perhaps ninety per cent pass through his hands: the
greater portion is of course stored away for food to last during the
winter and spring, but some of them are tucked separately into loosely
covered holes, where some of the seeds germinate and become trees....</p>

<p>One never tires of this bright chip of nature,—this brave little voice
crying in the wilderness,—of observing his many works and ways, and
listening to his curious language. His musical, piny gossip is as savory
to the ear as balsam to the palate; and, though he has not exactly
the gift of song, some of his notes are as sweet as those of a linnet—almost
flute-like in softness, while others prick and tingle like thistles.
He is the mocking-bird of squirrels, pouring forth mixed chatter and
song like a perennial fountain; barking like a dog, screaming like a
hawk, chirping like a blackbird or a sparrow; while in bluff, audacious
noisiness he is a very jay.</p>

<p>In descending the trunk of a tree with the intention of alighting on
the ground, he preserves a cautious silence, mindful, perhaps, of foxes
and wildcats; but while rocking safely at home in the pine-tops there
is no end to his capers and noise; and woe to the gray squirrel or
chipmunk that ventures to set foot on his favorite tree! No matter
how slyly they trace the furrows of the bark, they are speedily discovered,
and kicked downstairs with comic vehemence, while a torrent
of angry notes comes rushing from his whiskered lips that sounds
remarkably like swearing. He will even attempt at times to drive
away dogs and men, especially if he has had no previous knowledge
of them. Seeing a man for the first time, he approaches nearer and
nearer, until within a few feet; then, with angry outburst, he makes a
sudden rush, all teeth and eyes, as if about to eat you up. But, finding
that the big forked animal doesn’t scare, he prudently beats a retreat,
and sets himself up to reconnoiter on some overhanging branch, scrutinizing
every movement you make with ludicrous solemnity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Muir thus tells of an amusing experience he had with
a Douglas squirrel that he found at his breakfast:</p>

<p>Breakfast done, I whistled a tune for him before he went to work,
curious to see how he would be affected by it. He had not seen me all
this while; but the instant I began to whistle he darted up the tree
nearest to him, and came out on a small dead limb opposite me, and
composed himself to listen. I sang and whistled more than a dozen
airs, and as the music changed his eyes sparkled, and he turned his
head quickly from side to side, but made no other response. Other
squirrels, hearing the strange sounds, came around on all sides, also
chipmunks and birds. One of the birds, a handsome, speckle-breasted
thrush, seemed even more interested than the squirrels. After listening
for awhile on one of the lower dead sprays of a pine, he came
swooping forward within a few feet of my face, and remained fluttering
in the air for half a minute or so, sustaining himself with
whirring wing-beats, like a humming-bird in front of a flower, while
I could look into his eyes and see his innocent wonder.</p>

<p>By this time my performance must have lasted nearly half an hour.
I sang or whistled “Bonnie Doon,” “Lass o’ Gowrie,” “O’er the Water
to Charlie,” “Bonnie Woods o’ Cragie Lee,” etc., all of which seemed
to be listened to with bright interest, my first Douglas sitting patiently
through it all, with his telling eyes fixed upon me until I ventured to
give the “Old Hundredth,” when he screamed his Indian name,
Pillillooeet, turned tail, and darted with ludicrous haste up the tree out
of sight, his voice and actions in the case leaving a somewhat profane
impression, as if he had said, “I’ll be hanged if you get me to hear anything
so solemn and unpiney.” This acted as a signal for the general
dispersal of the whole hairy tribe, though the birds seemed willing to
wait further developments, music being naturally more in their line.</p>

<p>What there can be in that grand old church tune that is so offensive
to birds and squirrels I can’t imagine. A year or two after this High
Sierra concert, I was sitting one fine day on a hill in the Coast Range,
where the common Ground Squirrels were abundant. They were very
shy on account of being hunted so much; but after I had been silent
and motionless for half an hour or so they began to venture out of
their holes and to feed on the seeds of the grasses and thistles around
me as if I were no more to be feared than a tree-stump. Then it
occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to find out whether
they also disliked “Old Hundredth.” Therefore I began to whistle as
nearly as I could remember the same familiar airs that had pleased the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
mountaineers of the Sierra. They at once stopped eating, stood erect
and listened patiently until I came to “Old Hundredth,” when with
ludicrous haste every one of them rushed in their holes and bolted
in, their feet twinkling in the air for a moment as they vanished.—From

<p>Once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of
noble manners, in the presence of a man or woman who have no bar
in their nature, but whose character emanates freely in their word
and gesture. A beautiful form is better than a beautiful face; a beautiful
behavior is better than a beautiful form: it gives a higher pleasure
than statues or pictures,—it is the finest of the fine arts. A man
is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature, yet, by the
moral quality radiating from his countenance, he may abolish all considerations
of magnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the
world. I have seen an individual, whose manners, though wholly
within the conventions of elegant society, were never learned there,
but were original and commanding, and held out protection and prosperity;
one who did not need the aid of a court-suit, but carried the
holiday in his eye; who exhilarated the fancy by flinging wide the
doors of new modes of existence; who shook off the captivity of etiquette,
with happy spirited bearing, good-natured and free as Robin
Hood; yet with the port of an emperor, if need be, calm, serious, and
fit to stand the gaze of millions.</p>

<p>Look at ourselves. Look at man; his reason, intelligence, and discoveries.

<p>Education is a companion which no misfortune can depress—no
crime can destroy—no enemy can alienate—no despotism enslave. At
home, a friend—abroad, an introduction—in solitude, a solace—and in
society, an ornament. It chastens vice—it guides virtue—it gives at
once grace and government to genius—without it, what is Man? A
splendid slave—a reasoning savage!</p>

<p>Just before Napoleon set out for the court of Belgium, he sent to
the cleverest artisan of his class in Paris, and demanded of him
whether he would engage to make a coat of mail, to be worn under
the ordinary dress, which should be absolutely bullet-proof; and that
if so, he might name his own price for such a work. The man engaged
to make the desired object, if allowed proper time, and he named
eighteen thousand francs as the price of it. The bargain was concluded,
and in due time the work was produced, and its maker honored
with a second audience of the emperor. “Now,” said his imperial
majesty, “put it on.” The man did so. “As I am to stake my life on
its efficacy, you will, I suppose, have no objections to do the same.”
And he took a brace of pistols, and prepared to discharge one of
them at the breast of the astonished artisan. There was no retreating,
however, and half-dead with fear, he stood the fire, and, to the infinite
credit of his work, with perfect impunity. But the emperor was not
content with one trial; he fired the second pistol at the back of the
trembling artisan, and afterwards discharged a fowling-piece at another
part of him, with similar effect. “Well,” said the emperor, “you
have produced a capital work, undoubtedly—what is the price of it?”
“Eighteen thousand francs were named as the agreed sum.” “There is
an order for them,” said the emperor, “and here is another, for an
equal sum, for the fright that I gave you.”</p>

<h4>WORK AND THE WORKER</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Theodore Roosevelt</span></p>

<p>There are any number of different kinds of work we have to do, all
of which have to be done. There is the work of the farmer, the work
of the business man, the work of the skilled mechanic, the work of the
men to whom I owe my safety every day and every night—the work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the railroad men; the work of the lawyer, the work of the sailor, the
work of the soldier, the work in ten thousand ways; it is all good
work; it does not make any difference what work the man is doing if
he does it well. If the man is a slacker, a shiftless creature, I wish
we could get rid of him. He is of no use. In every occupation you
will find some men whom you will have to carry. You cannot do
much with them. Every one of us will stumble at times, and shame
to the man who does not at such times stretch out a helping hand, but
if the man lies down you cannot carry him to any permanent use.
What I would plead for is that we recognize the fact that all must
work, that we bring up our children to work, so that each respects
the other. I do not care whether a man is a banker or a bricklayer;
if he is a good banker or a good bricklayer he is a good citizen; if he
is dishonest, if he is tricky, if he shirks his job or tries to cheat his
neighbor, be he great or small, be he the poor man cheating the rich
man, or the rich man oppressing the poor man, in either case he is a
bad citizen.—Remarks at Berenda, California, May 18, 1903.</p>

<h4>THE MUSIC OF AMERICA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Roscoe Gilmore Stott</span></p>

<p>This is the Music of America:</p>

<p>Above the fret of a hundred routine duties and a thousand cares
rises the clarion Soprano. It comes from the joyful throats of millions
of women, blest beyond their sorrowing sisters who dwell on
foreign shores. It is the voice of the clear-eyed schoolgirl, romping
her happy way from a world of books into a gentler world of love;
of the self-reliant sister who is facing the forces of business with
spirit courageous and step that has never learned to falter; of the
mother of a tender brood and, blended into the melody her own heart
makes, the sweet, lisped crooning from the child at her bosom.</p>

<p>The Tenor notes are strong and full of golden promises. They
come from souls that have climbed above the city’s boldest heights.
They come from the souls of self-forgetful men—a proud nation’s
watchers upon her towers whose eager eyes scan the far stretches that
they may guard with loyalty against the perfidy of home or foreign
foes. The Tenor is the united voices of the poets and philosophers, of
the reformers and statesmen—yes, and of all that growing host who
have scaled to the peak of some new Sinai, that the people may not
forget the Almighty’s will concerning them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Listen, and you will mark the rich, rounded tones of the Contralto—from
the great-hearted organizations of Charity. Mingled into one
vast, sweeping tone—quivering with sympathy, vibrant with a heart’s
best faith—is the voice of the nurse, bending above some frail or
stricken sufferer; the voice of the matron at the threshold of some
gracious Door of Hope; the voice of the orphanage, the voice of the
infirmary, the voice of the rescue mission, the voice of the Salvation
Army, the voice of the Red Cross, the voice of the Christian Association,
the voice of the Church.</p>

<p>And underneath the united harmony of Soprano and Contralto, under
the inspiring silver thread of Tenor, there comes the wonderful
support of all, the basis of a nation’s Song of Hope—the splendid and
terrible contribution of strong-armed, mighty-limbed Labor—the Bass.
In the low, deep resonance of the singer’s rare volume one may catch
a vision of men, stern of visage and powerful in action, dominated by
the happy unity of Will and Service, pouring down into depths of
Mother Earth, that other men may have homes that radiate a social
warmth; a vision of men at forge and flame, at plow and pruning-hook,
at threshing-machine and throttle. The mighty voice thrills with
the shriek of a million factory whistles, of sea and river craft, of rushing
locomotives competing against Time and Space.... Underneath
all, the splendid and terrible tones of a giant singer.</p>

<p>So, let us be glad and rejoice! The All-King, as He sits on the
White Throne, marshaling His worlds, pauses. He bends a listening
ear, and surely His heart is made glad with an overpowering happiness
as His ears catch the strains of a grateful people’s reverence—as He
listens to the Music of America!—From <i>The Ladies Home Journal</i>.</p>

<h4>THE VIRTUES OF LOVE</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Saint Paul the Apostle</span></p>

<p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

<p>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries,
and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>

<p>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.</p>

<p>Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth
not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth
all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

<p>Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall
fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>

<p>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that
which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish
things.</p>

<p>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now
I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

<p>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest
of these is charity.—I Corinthians, XIII.</p>

<h4>THE MAJESTY OF THE OCEAN</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By “Proteus”</span></p>

<p>My first view of it was on a clear, but gusty afternoon of autumn.
The winds had been abroad for many hours; and as I looked seaward
from the high promontory, and beheld the long, rough surges rushing
towards me, and listened to their wild roar as they were flung back
from the caverned battlements at my feet, I felt as if the pillars of the
universe were shaken around me, and stood awed and abashed before
the majesty of excited nature. Since then, I have been on lofty precipices
while the thunder-cloud was bursting below me—have leaned
over the trembling brink of Niagara, and walked within its awful
chambers, but the thrill of that moment has never returned. The feeling
of awe, however, gradually gave place to an intense but pleasing
emotion, and I longed to spring away from the tame and trodden
earth, to that wild, mysterious world, whose strange scenes broke so
magnificently upon my vision. No wonder that our first roving impulses
are towards the ocean. No wonder that the romance and adventurous
spirit of youth deems lightly of hardship and peril, when
aroused by its stirring presentations. There is something so winning
in the multiplied superstitions of its hardy wanderers—something so
fascinating in its calm beauty, and so animating in its stormy recklessness,
that the ties of country and kindred sit looser at our hearts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
as curiosity whispers of its unseen wonders. In after years, when the
bloom of existence has lost much of its brightness, when curiosity has
become enervated, and the powers of the imagination palsied, where
do we sooner return to renew their former pleasing excitement, than
to our remembered haunts by the ocean? We leave behind us all the
splendor and magnificence of art, all the voluptuous gratifications of
society—we break from the banquet and the dance, and fly away to the
solitary cliffs, where the sea-bird hides her nest. There the cares,
perplexities, and rude jostlings of opposing interests are for a while
forgotten. There the turmoil of human intercourse disquiets no longer.
There the sweat and dust of the crowded city are dispelled as the cool
sea-breeze comes gently athwart our feverish brow. In the exhilaration
of the scene, the blood gathers purer at the heart—its pulse-beat
is softer, and we feel once more a newness of life, amounting almost
to a transport. Delightful remembrances, that lie buried up under the
dross of the past, are reanimated, and the charm, the peace, and the
freshness of life’s morning innocence again finds in our bosom a welcome
and a home. The elastic spring of boyhood is in our step as
we chase the receding wave along the white beach, or leap wildly into
its glassy depths. In the low, billowy murmur that steals out upon
the air, our ear catches the pleasant, but long unheard music of other
years, like the remembered voice of a departed companion; and while
leaning over some beetling crag, glorious visions pass, thronging before
our eyes, as, in fancy, we rove through the coral groves, where the
mermaids have their emerald bower, or gaze at the hidden beauties,
the uncoveted gems, and the glittering argosies that repose amid the
stilly waters. The soul goes forth, as it were, to the hallowed and
undefiled temples of nature, to be purified of its earthly contamination.
She takes to herself wings, and flies away to the “uttermost parts of
the sea,” and even there she hears the voice of the Divine, witnesses
the manifestations of His power, experiences the kind guardianship of
His presence, and returns cheered and invigorated to renew her weary
pilgrimage.</p>

<h4>THE GRAY DAYS</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Robert J. Burdette</span></p>

<p>You don’t love the gray days now. You want the sunshiny days,
the roses and the carnations. Let me tell you, children, you will love
the gray days just as well when they come. Some day, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
heart is wearied, when the eyes are hot and tired and dry with weeping,
when the face is burned by the noonday sun, you will know how
like a kiss of blessedness from heaven comes the soft, cool touch of
the mist, creeping up out of the sea or coming down over the mountain,
until it folds you as the wings of a dove, and shuts you in with
peace and rest and hope, and the tenderness of God. Oh, you will
thank God again and again for the gray days.</p>

<p>In the utterance of words we are concerned with the following
terms: Pronunciation, Enunciation and Articulation. In
a general way their meanings are identical, but yet there is a
mark of difference characterizing each.</p>

<p><i>Pronunciation</i> has to do with the act of uttering a single
letter, syllable, word, sentence, or whole address. This concerns
<i>correctness</i>.</p>

<p><i>Enunciation</i> has to do with careful, distinct utterance so
that any word or any part of a word is completely audible.
This concerns <i>distinctness</i>.</p>

<p><i>Articulation</i> has to do with the act of gracefully and skillfully
manipulating those organs of speech necessary for the
correct pronunciation and distinct enunciation of words. This
concerns <i>skillfulness</i>.</p>

<p>At least a part of the following exercises should be practiced
daily, preferably in the morning. A few minutes’ practice
is a splendid tonic for the tasks of the day.</p>

<h5>SIMON SHORT’S SON SAMUEL</h5>

<p>Shrewd Simon Short sewed shoes. Seventeen summers’ speeding
storms, spreading sunshine, successively saw Simon’s small shabby
shop still stanch; saw Samuel’s self-same squeaking sign still swinging,
silently speechifying: “Simon Short, Smithfield’s sole surviving
shoemaker, shoes sewed, soled superfinely.”</p>

<p>Simon’s spry, sedulous spouse, Sally Short, sewed shirts, stitched
sheets, stuffed sofas. Simon’s six stout, sturdy sons, Seth, Samuel,
Stephen, Saul, Shadrach, Silas—sold sundries. Sober Seth sold sugar,
starch, spice; Simple Samuel sold saddles, stirrups, screws; sagacious
Stephen sold silks, satins, shawls; skeptical Saul sold silver salvers;
selfish Shadrach sold salves, shoestrings, soap, skates, saws, sausages,
sawdust; slack Silas sold Sally Short’s stuffed sofas.</p>

<p>Some seven summers since, Simon’s second son, Samuel, saw Sophia
Sophronia Spriggs, sweet, sensible, smart Sophronia Spriggs. Sam
showed strange symptoms. Sam seldom stayed storing, selling saddles.
Sam sighed sorrowfully, sought Sophia Sophronia Spriggs’ society;
sung several serenades slyly. Simon stormed, scolded severely,
said Sam seemed so silly singing such shameful, senseless songs.
“Strange, Sam should slight such splendid summer sales! Strutting
Spendthrift! Shatter-brained simpleton!”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, sire!” said Sally. “Sam’s smitten; Sam’s spied some
sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“Sentimental schoolboy!” snarled Simon. “Smitten! stop such stuff!”
Simon sent Sally’s snuffbox spinning, seized Sally’s scissors, smashed
Sally’s spectacles, scattered several spools. “Sneaking scoundrel!
Sam’s shocking silliness shall surcease!” Scowling Simon stopped
speaking, starting swiftly shopward. Sally sighed sadly. Summoning
Sam, she spoke sweet sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“Sam,” said she, “Sire seems singularly snappy; so, sonny, stop
strutting streets, stop smoking segars, spending specie superfluously,
stop sprucing so, stop singing serenades, stop short! Sell saddles sensibly.
See Sophia Sophronia Spriggs soon; she’s sprightly; she’s
stable. So, solicit, sue, secure Sophia speedily, Sam.”</p>

<p>“So soon? So soon?” said Sam, standing stock-still.</p>

<p>“So soon, surely,” said Sally, smiling, “’specially since Sire shows
such spirits.”</p>

<p>So Sam, somewhat scared, sauntered slowly, shaking stupendously.
Sam soliloquizes: “Sophia Sophronia Spriggs—Spriggs—Samuel
Short’s spouse—sounds splendid. Suppose she should say—shoo? She
shan’t! She shan’t!”</p>

<p>Soon Sam spied Sophia starching shirts, singing softly. Seeing Sam,
she stopped starching, saluted Sam smilingly. Sam stammered shockingly:
“Spl-spl-splendid summer season, Sophia.”</p>

<p>“Somewhat sultry,” suggested Sophia.</p>

<p>“Sar-sartin, Sophia,” said Sam! (Silence seventeen seconds.)</p>

<p>“Selling saddles, still, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Sartin,” said Sam, starting suddenly. “Season’s somewhat sudorific,”
said Sam, stealthily staunching sweat, shaking sensibly.</p>

<p>“Sartin,” said Sophia, significantly. “Sip some sherbert, Sam?”
(Silence sixty seconds.)</p>

<p>“Sire shot sixty sheldrakes, Saturday,” said Sophia.</p>

<p>“Sixty? sho!” said Sam. (Silence seventy seconds.)</p>

<p>“See Sister Susan’s sunflowers,” said Sophia, sociably scattering such
stiff silence.</p>

<p>Sophia’s sprightly sauciness stimulated Sam strangely; so Sam suddenly
spoke sentimentally, “Sophia, Susan’s sunflowers seem saying,
‘Samuel Short, Sophia Sophronia Spriggs, stroll serenely, sequestered
spot, some sylvan shade. Sparkling springs shall sing soul-soothing
strains; sweet songsters shall silence secret sighings; super-angelic
sylphs shall—’”</p>

<p>Sophia snickered, so Sam stopped.</p>

<p>“Sophia,” said Sam solemnly.</p>

<p>“Sam,” said Sophia.</p>

<p>“Sophia, stop smiling. Sam Short’s sincere. Sam’s seeking some
spouse, Sophia!”</p>

<p>Sophia stood silent.</p>

<p>“Speak! Sophia, speak! Such suspense stimulates sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Seek Sire, Sam, seek Sire!”</p>

<p>Sam sought Sire Spriggs. Sire Spriggs said, “Sartin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>So Sophia Sophronia Spriggs serenely signs Sam’s screeds “Sophia
Sophronia Spriggs Short.”</p>

fact that Bill’s bill-board held all his money, the said Bill was unable
to settle the board-bill. Bill’s landlady was much bored with Bill, with
Bill’s board-bill and with Bill’s bill-board. Bill also became bored
with himself, bored with his landlady, bored with his board-bill, and
bored with his bill-board. So Bill, bored and bored and bored by her
who was also bored and bored and bored, sold his bill-board and paid
his board-bill; and thus Bill who was often bored and the board that
was often billed and the bill that often bored—Bill, bill-board and
board-bill, together with the thrice-bored board-bill lady served to make
history, the reading of which continues to bore all owners of bill-boards

<h5>FAR-FAMED FAIRY TALE OF FENELLA<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h5>

<p>(1) A Famous Fish Factor Found himself Father of Five Fine Flirting
Females—Fanny, Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and Fenella. (2)
The First Four were Flat-Featured, ill-Favored, Forbidding-Faced,
Freckled Frumps; Fretful, Flippant, Foolish, and Flaunting. (3)
Fenella was a Fine-Featured, Fresh, Fleet-Footed Fairy; Frank, Free
and Full of Fun. (4) The Fisher Failed and was Forced by Fickle
Fortune to Forego his Footman, Forfeit his Forefather’s Fine Fields,
and Find a Forlorn Farmhouse in a Forsaken Forest. (5) The Four
Fretful Females, Fond of Figuring at Feasts in Feathers and Fashionable
Finery, Fumed at their Fugitive Father. (6) Forsaken by
Fulsome, Flattering Fortune-hunters, who Followed them when Fish
Flourished, Fenella Fondled her Father, Flavored their Food, Forgot
her Flattering Followers, and Frolicked in Frieze without Flounces.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
(7) The Father, Finding himself Forced to Forage in Foreign parts
for a Fortune, Found he could afford a Fairing For his Five Fondlings.
(8) The First Four were Fain to Foster their Frivolity with
Fine Frills and Fans, Fit to Finish their Father’s Finances; Fenella,
Fearful of Flooring him, Formed a Fancy For a Full, Fresh Flower.
(9) Fate Favored the Fish-Factor For a Few days, when he Fell in
with a Fog; his Faithful <i>Filly’s</i> Footsteps Faltered, and Food Failed.
(10) He Found himself in Front of a Fortified Fortress. Finding it
Forsaken, and Feeling himself Feeble and Forlorn with Fasting, he
Fed upon the Fish, Flesh and Fowl he Found, Fricasseed and Fried;
and when Full, Fell Flat on the Floor. (11) Fresh in the Forenoon
he Forthwith Flew to the Fruitful Fields, and, not Forgetting Fenella,
he Filched a Fair Flower; when a Foul, Frightful, Fiendish Figure
Flashed Forth, “Felonious Fellow!—Fingering my Flower—I’ll Finish
you! Go, say Farewell to your Fine, Felicitous Family, and Face me
in a Fortnight.” (12) The Faint-hearted Fisher Fumed and Faltered,
and Fast was Far in his Flight. (13) His Five daughters Flew to
Fall at his Feet, and Fervently Felicitate him. (14) Frantically and
Fluently he unfolded his Fate. (15) Fenella, Forthwith, Fortified by
Filial Fondness, Followed her Father’s Footsteps, and Flung her
Faultless Form at the Foot of the Frightful Figure, who Forgave the
Father, and Fell Flat on his Face; For he had Fervently Fallen in a
Fiery Fit of love For the Fair Fenella. (16) He Feasted and Fostered
her, till, Fascinated by his Faithfulness, she Forgot the Ferocity of his
Face, Form and Feature; and Frankly and Fondly Fixed Friday Fifth
of February, For the affair to come off. (17) There were present at
the wedding, Fanny, Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and the Fisher.
(18) There were Festivity, Fragrance, Finery, Fireworks, Fricasseed
Frogs, Fritters, Fish, Flesh, Fowl and Furmenty; Frontignac, Flip,
and Fare Fit For the Fastidious; Fruit, Fuss, Flambeaux, Four Fat
Fiddlers, and Fifers; and the Frightful Form of the Fortunate and
Frumpish Fiend Fell From him, and he Fell at Fenella’s Feet, a Fair-Favored,
Fine, Frank Freeman of the Forest! (19) Behold the Fruits
of Filial affection!—<i>Comic Times.</i></p>

<p>If one has a little spare time, he can use it to good advantage
in making alliterative exercises for himself. It will enlarge
his vocabulary, discipline him in the use of unfamiliar words,
and, at the same time, afford him opportunity for linguistic
practice for the improvement of his pronunciation, enunciation

<h5>MIGHTY MAJESTIC MIND</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Man’s Muscular, Mental, Moral Master</span></p>

<p>Mind magnificently masters man. Mind majestically manages man’s
muscular, mental, moral movements. Man moves materially. Material
movements mean motions made muscularly, mechanically. Man’s mechanics
move as man’s mind mandates. Mere mechanical-man, muscular-man,
means microcosmic majesty, but man’s moral mentality,
mysteriously manifests man’s Mighty Maker’s magnificent, matchless
majesty. Mind manifestations mean mentation, mystery, method, municipal
management, music, melody, multifarious manufactures, market
manipulations, Marconi messages, macadamization, motor movements,
mechanical mastery, metallic mixtures, muscular motions mentally
mandated, maritime maneuvers, magnetic mastery. Men’s mental missteps
mean misery, morbidity, moroseness, many moon’s mournful meditations.
Man’s mind mismanaged means mental mirages, miserable
miserliness, mean marriages. Many men marry mistakenly, merely
marking mean mentality, moral mismanagement. Miserable marriages
mean morbid mouthings, misleading marital mirages, moral missteps,
monotonous months, mean moments, miserable meetings. Mean, malicious,
morally morbid, meddling marplots make many marriage mates
miserable, mouthing mendacious misstatements, manufacturing mean
messages, making matrons mutely meditate mauling mysterious maidens
who merrily manipulate meager-minded men. Methodistical, Mennonite
maidens, meditating many men’s malodorous matrimonial mishaps,
mercilessly meditate maidenhood, mocking marriage misfits.
Maidens morally, mentally, muscularly married, majestically move
matronward, meeting motherhood merrily. Mighty Majestic Mind
made Maiden Mary’s motherhood mysteriously materialize. Moral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
man’s meditations magnify Maiden Mary’s marvelous motherhood.
Mans’, matrons’, maidens’ managed mentations mean mentally-manipulated
meritorious monogamous marriages, making mates materially
merry, managing maternity modernly. Moreover, man’s managed
mentations mean mercantile might, maritime majesty, masterly mechanics,
monkish manuscripts, marble mansions, moon maps, martial
maneuvers, military marchings, magnificent masquerades, mail movements,
mystic materializations, mathematical mazes, Maypole maidens,
molded medals, modern medicine, megalithic monuments, musical megaphones,
melodramatic monologues, man’s melioration, mellow memories,
Mennonite missionaries, merciful mandatories, Messianic
masses, metaphysical messages, mighty metaphors, metaphrastic metamorphoses,
metallic mercuries, marvelous metropolises, Methodistic
morals, monks’ meditations, Mohammedan mosques, miniature minarets,
masterful ministers, miraculous mirrors, martial mobilizations,
multiplied musicians, marble mosaics, meaningful mottoes. Mendelssohn
made manifold music, monkish masses, modulated madrigals,
mincing minuets, military marches. Moor mountebanks make money
monkey-shining. Melancthon’s managed mentality materialized moral
mottoes, manuscripts, mandates, mental manna for mighty monarchs,
manifold multitudes. Macbeth’s moral missteps materialized manichean
morbidity, malignant moroseness, murderous manifestations,
maniacal madness. Merry Maryland’s melody moves men’s, matrons’,
maidens’ muscular movements mightily. More meditation might materialize
many more m-made mental meanderings.</p>

<h5>SOUL SUBLIME</h5>

<p>Spirit sees spirit surely. Spirit shuns sensuous symbols, shibboleths,
signs, sins. Spirit seeks serenity, sociability, salvation, supreme spiritual
standards, splendid sympathy, starlike success. Sin, sensuality,
sear, singe, scorch, send suffering, sorrow, sadness. Spirit, soul, soaring
supremely, senses slumber soundly. Senses sleep, spirit solves.
Soul subjects senses securely—sight, sound, smell, space—storing spirit
secrets, sweet sounds, soulful sympathy. Spirit sends soul starward
seeking spirit’s shoreless, shining seas sublimely serene. Soul survives
sense’s subjugation. Soul seeks successful solutions such staggerers
as syncopation, syncretism, syndicalism, symbiosis, symmetricalism,
synesthesia, synovitis, syringomyelia, strumæ, stronglyidæ,
strobilation, stock swindling, solfatara, solaria, Sivaism, Shintoism,
sisymbriums, siphonophora, shunning shilly-shallying, sloppy sentimentality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
slippery sneakiness, sulky slovenliness, secret sinfulness,
shekel stealing, saucy slandering.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One might write a “Wordy Wabble on Women,” telling
how “women wheedle wary woodmen woefully in western,
wild Wyoming and Washington. Warring, waspish women
wear war-paint wielding willow wands whackingly when
weary Willies wantonly waste wages,” and so on. Or he
could picture Dauntless Daniel daringly defying Desperate
Desmond. A war correspondent might have gained fame a few
years ago had he headed his German letter: “Blatant Billy
Blusteringly, Belligerently, Bellows Braggingly,” and later he
might have told how “British bulldogs beat Billy’s bragging,
brutal, bullying battalions; beneficently, benignly, beautifully
backing beleaguered Belgium’s bruised, but brave batteries.
Billy bemoaned beaten battalions, but Bulldog Britain beamed
benignly, bantering Billy’s Brunswick backers, bagging Billy’s
belongings, bogging Billy’s boasted bootsteps. Britain’s bulldogs
made bragging, boasting Billy bow bendingly before bully
belligerents.”</p>

<p>Let not the intellectual student deem this kind of exercise
too frivolous. It will be of far greater benefit to him than
he is aware, especially if he will read and reread his alliterations,
with clear understanding, in accordance with the principles
laid down in the earlier part of Chapter I.</p>

<p>Of a different type, but equally useful as exercises in composition,
and intelligent and carefully articulated reading, are
such compositions as the following. Let the student try to
make up something of the kind descriptive of a battle, a rainstorm,
an earthquake, etc.</p>

<p>A man whose vocabulary seems to be unlimited when he

<h4><span class="smcap">The Habit of Swallowing the “G”</span></h4>

<h5><i>The Problem</i></h5>

<p>It is strange why so many people fail to sound the “ing”
ending clearly when in reality to do so requires less effort than
not to. There is no better way of describing it than the swallowing
of the “g.”</p>

<p>Let us take the word “running” and determine the action of
the tongue in the proper and improper enunciation of the “ing.”</p>

<p>1. Repeat it as “runnin’” and note the position of the tongue
tip at the end of the word. You will find it pressed against
the roof of the mouth just back of the upper front teeth. You
will also note that the vowel sound “i” is changed to “u.”</p>

<p>2. Now repeat “running.” You will discover the mouth is
more open, and the tongue tip just back of the <i>lower</i> front
teeth, and the pure vowel quality of “i” is retained.</p>

<h5><i>Evil Effects</i></h5>

<p>There are three serious effects upon the person who persists
in swallowing his “g’s”:</p>

<p class="hanging">1. It causes a restricted throat, and consequently a tired one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">2. It causes a stoppage of pure tone, and consequently develops
nasality.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. It shows a lack of care and culture.</p>

<h4><i>Practice Exercises</i></h4>

<p>Repeat the following exercises with distinctness and precision:</p>

<p class="hanging">1. Beng, bang, bawng, bahng, bong, boong.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Deng, dang, dawng, dahng, dong, doong.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Feng, fang, fawng, fahng, fong, foong.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Geng, gang, gawng, gahng, gong, goong, (Hard “g”

<h4><span class="smcap">Overcoming the Rising Inflection</span></h4>

<p>One of the most effective elements of convincing speech is
the <i>inflection</i>.</p>

<p>By <i>inflection</i> is meant the glide of the voice to a higher or
lower pitch. This glide may be quick and short, or long and
slow. It may be a rising or falling glide, or both.</p>

<p>Complaints are constantly being made against the improper
use of the “rising inflection.” This misuse of one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
invaluable agencies for forceful utterance is persistently indulged
in by the majority of students. It is a common fault.</p>

<p>Its disastrous effect does not lie merely in ineffectiveness of
speech, yet that in itself ought to be sufficient cause for its cure,
but rather in its destructibility of the pupil’s will-power and
self-confidence. The pupil who has persisted in answering
with a question mark in his voice is indelibly marked. He is
likely to be dependent instead of independent and dependable;
he is groping in the dark for a crutch in order to keep his
mental balance.</p>

<p>The most flagrant causes for such improper and inexcusable
speech may be enumerated under two heads:</p>

<h5><i>On the Part of the Pupil</i></h5>

<p>The pupil is not sure of the answer.</p>

<p>The pupil wishes to please the teacher.</p>

<p>The pupil is not sure he has answered enough.</p>

<p>The pupil fears he will make a mistake.</p>

<p>The pupil waits for the teacher to verify his answer.</p>

<p>The pupil is not sure of what he intends to say.</p>

<p>The pupil does not believe what he says. He is in doubt.</p>

<p>The pupil does not concentrate.</p>

<p>The pupil is careless and lazy.</p>

<h5><i>On the Part of the Teacher</i></h5>

<p>The teacher throws out suggestive hints of the answer and
the pupil answers in guesses.</p>

<p>The teacher’s question has not been clearly put.</p>

<p>The teacher has not definitely planned the lesson and consequently
uses the rising inflection too often.</p>

<p>The teacher does not demand definite and clear thought from
pupils.</p>

<p>The teacher accepts slovenly work.</p>

<p>The teacher grows calloused to the sound of the inflection
because of its never ceasing recurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Is it not a lamentable fact that our schools have not given
the proper attention to eradicating this common and inexcusable
fault? Even in business and society the cultured ear is
continually annoyed by the common use of this abomination.</p>

<p>It is almost unbelievable that, out of twenty-five teachers
recently examined, but two were able to distinguish the good
and bad qualities of their own voices. Few teachers have ever
given serious thought to their own voices as invaluable instruments
in the carrying out of their duties.</p>

<p>At one time one of the authors made a careful study of the
effect of the teacher’s voice upon pupils. He visited the same
grade at the same hour on the same day in two different weeks
and in two different school-rooms. This is what he found.</p>

<p>In the first room the children were extremely nervous, restless,
unhappy and irritable. In the other room they were
quiet, restful, obedient and happy. In the first room the
teacher used a hard metallic tone, and usually spoke in quick,
short “jabs” of speech. There was little modulation of voice
and she seemed to be talking continuously, for when she was
silent her harsh tones seemed to continue reverberating in
his ears.</p>

<p>In the second room the teacher had splendid poise and a
pleasing, well-modulated and natural tone. Her voice as well
as her general manner had a soothing effect upon the children,
for, at the end of the day, they, as well as herself, were not
tired.</p>

<p>How often we hear people around us say of a public
speaker: Why doesn’t he speak so that people can hear him?
or more clearly and distinctly? etc.</p>

<p>During the training of would-be officers for our speedily
required army quite a number were passed as incompetent because
their voices were inadequate to give command. Only
recently one of the authors was present at a high school military
drill. The boy in command had a high, piping voice, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
which he had little control, and he was openly laughed at by
his fellows to his intense mortification and disgust. A good
voice, properly trained and obedient to the will of the personality
behind it is an invaluable asset in life to every one.</p>

<p>If one does not possess it, he must gain it, and to accomplish
this theory is of little or no avail. The student must practice
diligently and persistently. The following exercises are carefully
selected for the purpose of giving power and voice
control.</p>

<h5><i>Exercises Containing a Variety of Inflections</i></h5>

<p>Let each pupil decide for himself what he believes to be the
most effective and proper inflections in the following. In doing
this it is well to have him state his reason. This act of
reasoning will aid him in concentrating upon the thought

<p>The cold feeble dawn of a January morning was stealing in at the
windows of the common sleeping room, when Nicholas, raising himself
on his arm, looked among the prostrate forms in search of the
boy Smike.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” cried Squeer, from the bottom of the stairway, “are
you going to sleep all day, up there?”</p>

<p>“We shall be down directly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Down directly! You had better be down directly, or I’ll be down
on some of you in less time than directly. Where’s that Smike?”</p>

<p>Nicholas looked round again.</p>

<p>“He is not here, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me a lie. He is.”</p>

<p>“He is not. Don’t tell me.”</p>

<p>Squeers bounced into the dormitory, and, swinging his cane in the
air ready for a blow, darted into the corner where Smike usually lay
at night. The cane descended harmlessly. There was nobody there.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Where have you hid him?”</p>

<p>“I have seen nothing of him since last night.”</p>

<p>“Come, you won’t save him this way. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“At the bottom of the nearest pond for anything I know.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercises Developing Force and Rate of Speech</span></h4>

<h5>The Problem</h5>

<p>Here is a classification of people who speak peculiarly, or
incorrectly, <i>as far as voice is concerned</i>, with exercises for
correction.</p>

<p class="hanging">1. There are those who speak too fast.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. There are those who speak too slow.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. There are those who speak too low.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. There are those who speak too loud.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. There are those who speak too short with no melody of
tone.</p>

<p>Yet all of these may enunciate and pronounce their words
well. Besides developing distinctness, we must gain <i>control</i>
and <i>adaptability</i> of speech. It is strange, yet true, that many
speakers never increase the force or volume of their voices
when addressing a large assembly. They use the same quiet,
even tone appropriate in addressing a single person. What is
the result? They generally bore the audience, even though
their thoughts may be brilliant. There is no excuse for this,
as a few hours’ study and practice will change it. Above all
things one who attempts public speaking must speak so that
he can be heard. It is essential, therefore, to give ourselves
actual practice exercises which demand force of utterance.
Each student should demand of himself daily oral drill upon
certain exercises until he has mastered his own particular
difficulty.</p>

<p>The best means of accomplishing this is to use material from
good literature. In the following pages, under several heads,
is a variety of splendid exercises for practice. Commit all, or
at least a part, to memory. Thus, while developing your
speaking power, you will be cultivating a taste for the best
that our literature affords.</p>

<span class="smaller">CORRECTION OF SPEECH DEFECTS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In addition to the ordinary faults and failings in speech
possessed by many in common, there are the special and specific
defects, such as stammering, stuttering, lisping, and the
like. Every defective is to be pitied, as many professions and
occupations are of such a nature as practically to bar men and
women who cannot speak well. There are the social and ethical
handicaps, also, to be considered, as well as that of economics.
The defective speech of a child renders him the butt
of his playmates’ rude and often brutal jokes. The sensitive
is thus driven away from society. He becomes a solitary and
not infrequently his life is ruined.</p>

<p>Speaking of the stutterer, one who is not afflicted by this
disease (for so authorities have determined it to be), cannot
realize what a terrible life he lives. Dr. Scripture, of Columbia
University, New York City, who is one of the greatest
authorities on this subject, says: “One boy often threw himself
on the floor, begging his mother to tell him how to die.
Another boy asked for a letter to his father, telling him to keep
the other children from laughing at him. Many stutterers
become so sensitive that they imagine everybody is constantly
making fun of them. The life of a stutterer is usually so full
of sorrow that it can hardly be said to be worth living.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The speech delinquent is shy, timid, super-sensitive, constantly
harboring the thought that people are laughing at him.
He gradually shuns society, lives unto himself, and in many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
instances becomes morally depraved. He contracts a morbid
outlook upon life in general, and often is driven to criminality.
This statement is no exaggeration. The Board of Education
in New York City, after thorough investigation, found that
“one school child in four suffers from speech defect,” and that
“among boy criminals, nine in ten suffer from the same
malady.”</p>

<p>In the Grand Rapids schools classes for the sole purpose of
correcting speech defects were organized.</p>

<p>The mechanical arrangement was as follows: Twelve classes were
arranged for in five different schools with <i>a half hour a day</i> for each
class. The children were grouped according to age, kind of defect,
etc., and a teacher with special training for the correction of speech
was sent from school to school to give the instruction.</p>

<p>Our plans for this year (1918) are practically the same as for last
excepting that we have more special teachers and will be able to reach
a greater number of schools and give more time to individual cases....
During the school year of 1916-17, we had under instruction 107
children and obtained the following results:</p>

<p>This year we will have under instruction of our special teachers
about 250 children, and in addition to this we hope to work for correction
and prevention of speech-defects in general by giving instruction
in voice culture and corrective phonetics to all of the children
of the primary grades. This work will be done by the grade teachers
under the supervision of the speech department.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Problem</span></h4>

<p>A person with a slight impediment in his speech, due probably
to some minor organic disorder, could be much helped
by the average teacher, if the latter would give this subject of
speech serious consideration. Of course there are cases where,
from birth, the child’s speech organs have been impaired, and
again, disease or some surgical operation may have caused
interference with their proper functioning. In such cases as
these a speech specialist is needed and often medical aid as
well.</p>

<p>We do not presume to suggest with any degree of authority
just what to do and what not to do in such extremities, but
rather to present a few fundamental and tried principles
which have proved successful in many cases. There are two
classes whose speech defects are due to some mental cause—the
Stammerers and the Stutterers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Characteristics of the Stammerer</span></h4>

<p>The stammerer finds it extremely difficult to begin to make
any audible vocal sound. He stares blankly at you with a
very slight, if any, suggestion that he is trying to speak. For
the time being he is a mute, with no power to speak, and yet
with every means of speaking. This is a pitiful condition in
which to be.</p>

<p>The next stage finds the stammerer able, after a snapping of
his fingers, or bending of his knees, or lifting up of a foot, or
swinging his arms, or after some similar bodily action, to speak
along smoothly with no suggestion of an impediment for a considerable
period of time, after which he again lapses into
silence. The following characteristics are common to most
stammerers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. He is inclined to speak too fast when started.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. He has no control over his breathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">3. He often endeavors to speak during inhalation instead of
during exhalation.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. He is extremely sensitive, always fearing that he is making
a mistake.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. His face usually carries an expression of bitter sorrow
and despair.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. He is usually intensely grateful to any one for a kind
word of help.</p>

<p class="hanging">7. He tries with the utmost skill to conceal his defect.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. He is usually weak physically.</p>

<p class="hanging">9. He is usually of a nervous temperament.</p>

<p class="hanging">10. He usually possesses splendid courage and high ideals,
which too often are destroyed because he cannot accomplish
them with this weight of halting speech about
his neck.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Stutterer</span></h4>

<p>The stutterer, unlike the stammerer, is able to make an audible
sound at will. His difficulty lies in his inability to say
more than one sound until he has repeated the initial sound
from six to fifteen times. It seems that he must get up a certain
amount of speech momentum: “B-b-b-bring me th-th-th-that
b-b-b-book.” Or, “W-w-w-well, I think it is a v-v-v-very
fine day.”</p>

<p>In a large measure the causes of stuttering and stammering
are identical. Stammering is stuttering in the superlative
degree. What is true of the stammerer is also true of the
stutterer, with the exception that the stutterer is less melancholy,
and less conscious of his defect.</p>

<p>For both, or either, practice in simple exercises is very necessary,
but before specific training is given, the defective
should be interviewed concerning his health. If a boy or girl
is not given sufficient food and proper food (and such is often
the case), there is small chance for speech improvement. Oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
it is found that these speech delinquents are playing
too hard and wasting the nervous energy which should be utilized
in mastering their vocal impediment.</p>

<p>The most successful way of handling these problems is to
have the defectives placed in separate classes according to their
particular needs and ages. Then get a physician’s diagnosis
of each individual case. This diagnosis generally gives the
special teacher the knowledge necessary for intelligent correction.
The teacher must be patient, gentle, sympathetic and yet
determined. She herself must possess ease and real enjoyment
in speaking.</p>

<h5><i>Practice Exercises</i></h5>

<p>1. Speech defectives must first learn how to relax. They
should spend at least ten minutes daily at home lying flat on
their backs concentrating the mind on separate parts until the
whole body is completely relaxed. This relaxation exercise
can and should be carried on daily. At school, a similar
though modified exercise should be attempted.</p>

<p>2. They must master diaphragmatic breathing. This exercise
should follow the relaxation exercise, for the best results
are obtained while lying on the back; the next best while sitting
erect.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(a) Inhale slowly, filling lower lobes of lungs first, and then
the upper part of chest. While doing this count ten mentally;
exhale, counting ten mentally. Repeat five times.</p>

<p>(b) Inhale ten counts again, hold breath five counts, exhale
ten counts. Repeat five times.</p>

<p>(c) Inhale slightly, then purse lips to impede the air as it
passes out; now give one short puff with spasmodic contraction
of abdomen. Repeat five times, inhaling slightly
before each puff.</p>

<p>(d) Inhale deeply, then give one long puff with continuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
contraction of the abdomen. Repeat five times, inhaling
deeply before each puff.</p>

</div>

<p>3. Tone production should follow breathing exercises.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(a) Count orally 1-1-1-1-1 with spasmodic abdominal contraction.
Repeat five times. Be sure that breath is taken in
after each count.</p>

<p>(b) Count orally 1-1-1-1-1 with continuous abdominal contraction.
Repeat five times.</p>

<p>(c) Inhale deeply and count orally 1 to 10, stressing every
other count. Some students cannot do this unless the
teacher keeps time with ruler as a baton, striking some
object. Others can only do this by walking slowly, repeating
a count on every other footfall. Repeat five
times.</p>

<p>(d) Select a lyric with marked rhythm and read in concert in
sing-song style. Repeat each stanza five times, giving
marked pulsation to each accented syllable. Tennyson’s
“Song of the Brook” is especially good for this purpose.</p>

<p>(e) Take a simple prose selection and mark it off in thought
groups, and then read slowly and measuredly in concert,
giving a fairly long pause between each group. Hamlet’s
“Instructions to the Players,” and Lincoln’s “Gettysburg
Address” are splendid for such work.</p>

</div>

<p>When the defective has learned to speak fluently memorized
work, then he should be taught confidence in simple conversational
exercises. This work should be, so far as possible,
voluntary on the part of the pupil. Let the class form a circle,
each one sitting with a sense of ease and relaxation and
then, as they are inclined, take part in conversing on some
simple, interesting topic. Some will have to be urged to participate
while others find great delight in such work.</p>

<p>In regard to training in enunciation, this work has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
found to be more successful when given late in the development
of the defective. After he has gained confidence in
speech ability and cultivated, to some degree, real enjoyment
in voice production, he is better prepared to consider this more
or less purely technical training. In very extreme cases, however,
it will be found necessary to begin speech instruction
with him as you would teach a child. Such students must be
taught the proper control of lips, tongue and jaw, as though
they had never learned speech at all.</p>

<p>Experts who have devoted a lifetime to the study of speech
evils and their remedy find a large variety of causes for them,
as well as immense diversity in manifestation. One may seem
to be born with a tendency to stammering, stuttering or lisping;
another can trace the habit to a fright, to imitation, to
some exhaustive disease, to nervous timidity, to self-consciousness.
But whatever the cause, or however the evil manifests
itself, it is a living nightmare, a dreadful, ever-present burden
to its victim. Hence parents and teachers should seriously
endeavor to correct the habit as speedily as it is discovered.
For if it be long-continued it is almost sure to produce shyness,
timidity, lack of necessary self-reliance, even moroseness,
sullenness and other consequences of perpetual unhappiness.</p>

<p>At the outset let it be understood clearly that all harshness,
unkindness, or severity of treatment in word or deed, adds to
the evil and renders it more difficult of eradication. The victim
of the habit is to be sympathized with, and lovingly encouraged.
Yet promptness, firmness and persistency are essential
in the production of a cure. The following suggestions
should be put into practice, but seldom or never in the presence
of strangers, or at any time when they would heighten
the sufferer’s embarrassment. They must also be followed
with happy cheerfulness.</p>

<p>1. When a victim of one of these habits begins to stammer
or stutter, stop him immediately, and say pleasantly but firmly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and crisply, “Stop!” Then command: “Take a deep
breath! Now hold it! Now think of what you want to say—each
word!” Then allow the stutterer to let out his breath;
then inhale again deeply, and begin his speech. If he fails,
see that he begins again. Practice this as often as you can.
Exercises can also be made up, following the same procedure,
that will be of incalculable benefit, as, for instance, taking a
deep breath, then repeating as much of the alphabet as is possible
before breathing again.</p>

<p>2. Cultivate slowness of speech. Insist upon words being
spoken slowly, with great distinctness and clearness of articulation.
The moment stuttering begins, issue the commands:
“Stop! Deep breath; think; breathe out, breathe in; now!”
Let the teacher say his words very slowly and constantly encourage
the pupil to do the same.</p>

<p>3. Cultivate the habit of rapid thinking. This can be done
by a series of exercises played as games if necessary. For
instance: “The Game of Names.” The teacher says,
“Flower!” The pupil replies, “Rose.” If the teacher has a
list ready he can call out his names as quickly as possible, such
as, Animal, Tree, Water, Bird, Dog, etc., while the pupil
responds, Horse, Oak, River, Sparrow, Bulldog, etc. The interest
can be increased by repeating a generic term, requiring
a different species for answer. Flower, Animal, Tree, Water,
etc., can have a score or more of different answers.</p>

<p>Another exercise in prompt thinking is that of “Association
of Ideas.” The teacher gives out a name—whatever occurs to
him—as, for instance, “Tree.” The pupil immediately responds,
“Leaves.” Then the teacher may add, “Autumn,” and
the pupil, “Poetry,” and so on. Or the associations may all
be required from the pupil. The words used as <i>starters</i> should
be carefully chosen, of course, to meet the mental condition of
the pupil; such words as Baby, Doll, Mamma, Bed, House,
etc., being good for children of tender years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Another excellent exercise is that of “Contrasts or Differences,”
where the teacher says, “Boy,” and the pupil responds,
“Girl.” “Black” calls forth “white,” “heavy” is responded to
by “light,” etc.</p>

<p>Equally good is “Finishing Quotations” or “lines”—provided,
of course, the pupil is old enough for such a mental
exercise. For instance, the teacher says, “Everything is not
gold,” while the pupil should respond, “That glitters.” “My
country,” would bring out “’Tis of thee,” or “Right or wrong.”</p>

<p>Anything that quickens the intellect and demands ready response
is of material help, but the teacher must not forget that,
in this mental-promptness exercise, slow and deliberate speech
also are essential on his part and that of the pupil.</p>

<p>4. Whenever it is found that a pupil stammers or stutters
over a word beginning with a consonant, as, for instance,
“bread,” require him to drop out the initial letter and say
“read,” or even “ead.” Such words as pie, Tommy, tub, butter,
top, bank, tumble, tell, nut, lap, can be used. Let him say,
“ie,” “ommy,” “ub,” etc. Then when he is sure of this part
of the word, let him, after taking a deep breath, try the full
word, saying it again, but always slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>5. Teach the pupil to sing his sentences. Begin with some
simple salutation, as, “Where are you going?” and let it be
sung to the notes:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="music" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <p class="center"><a href="music/music.mp3">Listen</a> | <a href="music/music.mxl">MusicXML</a></p>
  <img class="w100" src="images/music.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Where are you going? I’m go-ing home.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then let a response be sung reversing the music, “I’m going
home.” “How do you do?” “Where are your father and
your mother?” “How far is it to the market?” are sentences
that can be sung. The teacher should invent his own music
and words, but insist upon slow, deliberate utterances of tone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and word. This is a wonderful help in certain kinds of cases.</p>

<p>6. There are certain simple exercises or calisthenics that
materially aid in strengthening the muscles of the head, neck,
throat, jaw, etc. The teacher can utilize these according to
his best judgment. Any book of calisthenic or physical exercises
will suggest those most useful.</p>

<p>7. But above all, in seeking a cure of these distressing evils,
use the psychical or spiritual remedy. Give the pupil confidence
that God never intended him to be cursed by a stammering,
stuttering, or lisping tongue. He is the child of an Infinite
and Loving Father. All good is his, if he will learn how to
take it. Urge him to restful, trustful reliance upon the tender
help of the Great Power outside of himself, in conjunction
with the efforts you and he together are making to effect a
cure.</p>

<p>To the teacher who needs thorough preparation upon this
subject we can commend heartily Dr. E. W. Scripture’s book
“Stuttering and Lisping,” published by the Macmillan Company,
New York.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="smaller">ENUNCIATION AND PRONUNCIATION</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The study of the subject of enunciation should come comparatively
late in the development of the pupil, say, beginning
with the fifth grade. There are other fundamentals that the
pupil should be well grounded in before any definite concentration
of effort should be put upon enunciation.</p>

<p>The majority of children and adults are backward in mastering
the art of correct speaking, therefore, if the teacher begins
by expecting the pupil to be accurate in enunciation, which
is really one of the finishing touches, he is in danger of deadening
forever the desire for self-expression and enjoyment in
speaking.</p>

<p>Pronunciation should precede any drill in enunciation. The
pupil is quick to grasp correctness in right pronunciation, and
desires it fully, but he cares little for enunciation. Most pupils
will shy just a little when you tell them that the proper way
to pronounce, or rather to enunciate the word <i>education</i> is
ed-u-ca-tion and not ed-ji-ca-tion. Or, take the vowel (a) as
in ask, which should be pronounced (ạ). Invariably the untutored
will give the vowel the extreme flat sound of (ă) as
in hăt, and will think that he is affected if he give it the proper
soft, broad sound. He will likely think this even if you compromise
with the sounds.</p>

<p>So our policy has been to forego acute criticism in enunciation
until the student has acquired considerable momentum in
speech-desire. In other words, we are more interested, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
his early studies, that he develop and cultivate the desire and
will to express, than that he express himself accurately. Then,
later, we gradually call his attention to his slovenly speech.
Above all things let us beware of quenching the sacred fire of
spontaneity, for without that all speech loses its charm and
power. Is it not better that the student be stimulated to
speech action, even though it be imperfect in some—even in
many—respects, than that he be conscious of all his defects and
never speak at all?</p>

<p>Clearness and precision in enunciation and pronunciation
mark the genuineness and strength of one’s character. Even
the brightest person, if he mispronounce his words, is accused
of mediocrity and is suspected of being unaccustomed to the
society of refined and cultured people. There should be daily
systematic drill in childhood when correct speech habits are
most quickly and firmly established. Another great advantage
of early training is that this is the period when the student
is least self-conscious.</p>

<p>There are three essentials for clear and exact enunciation
and pronunciation: First, an acute ear; second, diligent practice;
and third, constant vigilance. These three essentials
should be kept constantly in mind in carrying out the following
exercises. We should first see that the student’s ear can
detect the correct, pure resonances, and then pursue vigorous
practice in them. At first this kind of exercise is tedious and
irksome, but with accomplishment comes keen pleasure.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the vowel sounds. For the word exercises
we shall take words often mispronounced as well as
poorly enunciated. Thus we shall be doing two important
things: cultivating the ear, and improving word production.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercise One</span></h4>

<p>The vowels are either long, short, or diphthongal. The resonances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of the long vowels begin at the back, passing through
the middle, to the front of the mouth. Thus:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="vowels" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/vowels.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>The above represents the approximate and relative openings
of the mouth in long vowels.</p>

<p>You notice the mouth aperture is narrow at the back, wide
in the middle and narrow again at the front. For practice
AW and AH and OO are the most valuable because the two
chief difficulties of the student are; first, to open his mouth
wide enough, and second, to keep his speech forward on the
lips. Usually his speech is throaty. Practice the following

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercise Two</span></h4>

<p>In pronunciation there is a right and a wrong way. Some
people are so desirous of appearing exact in this matter that
they often introduce superfluous sounds. For example, such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
persons pronounce evil—ē´vĭl, instead of ē´vl; towards—tō-wŏrdz´
instead of tō´-erdz.</p>

<p>This habit of introducing an extra sound that is unnecessary
reflects upon the learning of the individual quite as much as
the neglecting of a sound that is necessary. Let us not attempt
to foster extravagant niceties of speech, but let us cultivate
in ourselves and our pupils an appreciation of, and a
desire for, pure, substantial, and impressively spoken English,
showing them that the real beauty of our language lies in its
simplicity and its inherent, convincing power.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercises in Enunciation and Pronunciation</span></h4>

<p>Take up the exercises below in the following manner:
First, discover the correct position of tongue, lips and jaw for
producing the particular sound under consideration. Second,
repeat the sound many times. See that you use your organs
of speech properly in regard to the positions indicated at the
beginning of each vowel exercise. After the repetition of
each sound, let lips, tongue and jaw relax to normal position.
Third, in repeating the words be sure the <i>ictus</i> or vocal stroke
is properly and decidedly placed.</p>

<p>The main purpose is to develop pure vowel resonance, but
inflectional freedom may be cultivated at the same time, if
great care is taken not to interfere with the correct vocal positions
of tongue, lips and jaw. Beware of a tendency in this
direction. (See discussion of Inflection in another part of this
book.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Key to Pronunciation</span></h4>

<p>In showing the correct pronunciation of words in the following
exercises, the simplest method has been adopted. The
words are rewritten with a set of letters which have invariably
the same sound and are familiar to everyone.</p>

<p><i>Webster’s New International Dictionary</i> and Phyfe’s <i>Words
Often Mispronounced</i> are the principal authorities consulted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>

<h5>THE JOY OF THE HUMAN VOICE</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>How much squandering there is of the voice! How little there is
of the advantage that may come from conversational tones! How
seldom does a man dare to acquit himself with pathos and fervor!
And the men are themselves mechanical and methodical in the bad
way who are most afraid of the artificial training that is given in the
schools, and who so often show by the fruit of their labor that the
want of oratory is the want of education.</p>

<p>How remarkable is the sweetness of voice in the mother, in the
father, in the household! The music of no chorded instruments
brought together is, for sweetness, like the music of familiar affection
when spoken by brother and sister, or by father and mother.</p>

<p class="right">—<span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher</span>, from “Lectures on Oratory.”</p>

</div>

<p>The one great object in reading is to get at the mind of the
author. What did he mean? What did he intend me to feel
as I read? What is his real message? How can I best reach
the mind and heart of the author, the poet, the dramatist,
through his written words?</p>

<p>This is the real mission of literature, and he is a poor
teacher who fails to impress the heart of his students with its
importance. Too often teachers spend the valuable time of
their students with matters of entirely subsidiary importance,
such as the style of the author, questions as to when, where
and how he wrote, his figures of speech, his methods of composition,
and the like. All these are of importance to those
who are learning to write, and are of interest to others, but
the prime reason for all literature is that the author has something
of greater or lesser importance to say, which he wishes
to reach the mind and heart of his reader.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, Browning’s exquisite short poem above.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
What good does it do the student to engage his attention with
Browning’s style, his verse forms, etc.? To him the matter
of prime importance is that he shall know what Browning
<i>meant</i>.</p>

<p><i>This is the vital question in all reading.</i></p>

<p>That literature which is a mere collection of fine words,
beautifully arranged in perfect sentences, is “as sounding brass
and a clanging cymbal.” To have any real significance it must
be surcharged with high, lofty, pure, stirring human emotion;
and to feel the same emotion that the writer felt as he penned
poem, essay, novel, story or drama is the aim of every intelligent
and thoughtful reader. One of the best possible ways of
accomplishing this is by reading aloud—even when one is
alone. One writer boldly affirms that we can never know the
vital, spiritual message of a writer until we have put his words
upon our tongue and sent them winging away in speech,
freighted with the meaning that has reached our minds.</p>

<p>In reading carefully this poem of Browning, observe if the
very nature of the theme does not demand the various modulations
of the human voice to give it adequate interpretation.
Repeat the first two lines, thinking of their purpose, and then
see if you do not feel somewhat of an emotional thrill which
must be akin to that which was felt by Browning when he
thought of his great teacher, that marvelous poet, Shelley.</p>

<p>Is it possible really to get the heart throb of this poem unless
we sing it out through the voice? The major portion of
time spent in literary study should be through oral interpretation.
Let a pupil read to you, and instantly you can detect
whether or not he understands what he is reading. Corson
said he believed the time is coming when examinations in literature
will be wholly oral. He goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Reading must supply all the deficiencies of written or printed language.
It must give life to the letter. How comparatively little is
addressed to the eye, in print or manuscript, of what has to be addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
to the ear by the reader! There are no indications of tone,
quality of voice, inflection, pitch, time, or any other of the vocal functions
demanded for a full intellectual and spiritual interpretation. A
poem is not truly a poem until it is voiced by an accomplished reader,
who has adequately assimilated it—in whom it has, to some extent,
been born again, according to his individual spiritual constitution and
experiences. The potentialities, so to speak, of the printed poem, must
be vocally realized. What Shelley, in his lines “To a Lady, With a
Guitar,” says of what the revealings of the instrument depend upon,
may be said with equal truth of the revealings of every true poem; it</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mood-Analysis</span></h4>

<p>The following is an illustration of what might be called the
“mood-analysis” of a selection. For the sake of convenience
the sentences in the excerpt are numbered. The important
thing for the student to bear in mind is to see that the author’s
purpose is completely grasped, and then render it in the proper
mood.</p>

<p><i>First</i>: Read the selection paragraph by paragraph. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
arrange the several points in their respective order. Now give
them orally as simply and progressively as possible.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: Read the selection again by paragraphs and this
time determine what are the important and unimportant words.
Then give these important words a greater force of utterance.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>: Do not fear to make many groups. It is imperative
to grasp the author’s ideas and pictures in separate detail.
When each of these has been well thought over, we are then
ready to put these separate parts into one complete and harmonious
whole.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>: Determine the mood which dominates each separate
picture or detail, then see how these fit into each other,
like the parts of a picture puzzle, perfecting the thought as a
whole and making it a living, harmonious, mental or spiritual
conception.</p>

<h5>THE MAN WHO WEARS THE BUTTON</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Mellen Thurston</span><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>1. Sometimes in passing along the street I meet a man who, in the
left lapel of his coat, wears a little, plain, modest, unassuming bronze
button. 2. The coat is often old and rusty; the face above it seamed
and furrowed by the toil and suffering of adverse years; perhaps beside
it hangs an empty sleeve, and below it stumps a wooden peg. 3. But
when I meet the man who wears that button I doff my hat and stand
uncovered in his presence—yea! to me the very dust his weary foot has
pressed is holy ground, for I know that man, in the dark hour of the
nation’s peril, bared his breast to the hell of battle to keep the flag of
our country in the Union sky.</p>

<p>4. Maybe at Donaldson he reached the inner trench; at Shiloh held
the broken line; at Chattanooga climbed the flame-swept hill, or
stormed the clouds on Lookout Heights. 5. He was not born or bred
to soldier life. 6. His country’s summons called him from the plow, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
forge, the bench, the loom, the mine, the store, the office, the college,
the sanctuary. 7. He did not fight for greed of gold, to find adventure,
or to win renown. 8. He loved the peace of quiet ways, and yet he
broke the clasp of clinging arms, turned from the witching glance of
tender eyes, left good-by kisses upon tiny lips to look death in the face
on desperate fields.</p>

<p>9. And when the war was over he quietly took up the broken threads
of love and life as best he could, a better citizen for having been so
good a soldier.</p>

<p>10. What mighty men have worn this same bronze button! Grant,
Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, and an hundred more, whose names are
written on the title-page of deathless fame. 11. Their glorious victories
are known of men; the history of their country gives them voice; the
white light of publicity illuminates them for every one. 12. But there
are thousands who, in humbler way, no less deserve applause. 13. How
many knightliest acts of chivalry were never seen beyond the line or
heard of above the roar of battle.</p>

<p>14. God bless the men who wear the button! 15. They pinned the
stars of Union in the azure of our flag with bayonets, and made atonement
for a nation’s sin in blood. 16. They took the negro from the
auction-block and at the altar of emancipation crowned him—citizen.
17. They supplemented “Yankee Doodle” with “Glory Hallelujah,” and
Yorktown with Appomattox. 18. Their powder woke the morn of universal
freedom and made the name “American” first in all the earth.
19. To us their memory is an inspiration, and to the future it is hope.—From
an address at a banquet of the Michigan Club of Detroit, February
21, 1890.</p>

<p>Now take Joaquin Miller’s magnificent and stirring poem
“Columbus” and analyze it in the same fashion. Here is the
analysis made of it by an intelligent reader on his own initiative,
without any knowledge of the method we would have
each student master and follow:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Student’s Analysis of “Columbus”</span></h4>

<p>First dwell upon the outlines of the history of Columbus,
his early struggles and mastery of hardships. Recall that it
was in his day that the new idea of the rotundity of the earth
was being largely discussed. Watch the growth of this idea
in his thought, until there springs up the confident assurance
that if this idea be true it must be possible to reach India—or
any other land—by sailing around the earth in <i>either</i> direction.
Confident of his idea, his scientific mind demands
knowledge, demonstration. He seeks help to find out. Is
rebuffed on every hand. Called crazy, insane, a fool, a lunatic.
The idea persists. It grows into an obsession. <i>He</i> knows,
and now his soul demands that he compel <i>other people</i> to
know. The more rebuffs the greater his determination. Get
hold here of the great fundamental thought that moves the
universe, that works all the marvels that man has accomplished,
viz., that when you link up with Truth, you are linked
up with God—the Supreme Power of the Universe—and there
cannot be any failure to a man so connected. All Columbus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
had to do was to <i>persist</i>. He did so, and finally Isabella and
Ferdinand were convinced, the money needed was raised, the
ship provided, and the happy, joyous Columbus sets sail to
demonstrate to the world that which his soul had already convinced
him was true.</p>

<p>Now remember the ignorance of the world at large on the
subject. Recall that his sailors were densely ignorant and
fearfully superstitious, but Columbus had never given that a
thought.</p>

<p>He sets sail, full of delight, happiness, confidence. Now
refer to the poem. 1. He and his sailors alike knew that the
islands of the Azores and the Gates of Hercules were behind
them. 2. Here, however, is a difference in the knowledge of
Columbus and his sailors. He, with the eye of scientific confidence,
could see ahead, though there was nothing in sight but
shoreless seas, not even the ghost of shores. The sailors saw
nothing but the uncharted and unknown seas. Do you not feel
their awe and superstitious fears? Can you not picture their
fearful whisperings together as they sail further and further
into the unknown? The mate is the means of communication
between them and the admiral. 3. Observe the <i>dread</i> of sailors
and mate. The stars with which they are familiar disappear
and new and strange ones appear, adding new fuel to their
superstitious fears. 4. The mate asks Columbus how he shall
reply to these fears. His mood is one of fear and growing
alarm excited into the action of questioning. 5. Now ask
yourself: What would be Columbus’s natural reply? Remember
he has given years of thought to this subject. He has
no question as to the success of the voyage. Expecting to sail
on uncharted seas, they have no fears for him. He <i>knows</i>
what he will find when he has gone far enough around. The
fears and questions of the mate are absurd, preposterous.
There is but one answer: Calmly and confidently he gives it,
“Why, say, Sail on! and on!” Matter of fact, almost indifferent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
totally unconscious of the seething fears bubbling up
every moment afresh in the hearts of his sailors. What kind
of intonation in his voice would such a question call forth?</p>

<p>6. For the time being the questionings of the men are satisfied,
and they <i>sail and sail</i> (don’t hurry in giving this repetition)
<i>as winds might blow</i>. The fears and questionings now
begin afresh. 7. The fear is indicated in the word <i>blanched</i>,
and in the mate’s words. 8. Being away from familiar scenes,
and all other men, his and his sailors’ small minds fear that
even God has lost sight of them. The winds are lost, God is
not here. 9. Hence there is increasing urgency in his second
appeal to the admiral. But Columbus (10), seeing the vision
that has been familiar to him for many years, and preoccupied
by his dream, neither sees any reason for fears, <i>nor does he
yet become aware of the fear</i> expressed in the mate’s voice.
His reply, therefore, is the quiet, scarcely heard voice of the
dreamer, given much lower and quieter than his ordinary talking
voice, but with the deep intensity of a man who has but
one purpose.</p>

<p>Pause now for a few moments to allow this quiet urge of
the admiral to <i>sink in</i>. Don’t hurry. Then let the next stanza
open with some degree of haste and excitement. 11. The
mate’s tone now is one of definite, open remonstrance. It is
all very well for his admiral to say “Sail on!” He—the mate—has
to come in direct conflict with the men. <i>They</i> are growing
mutinous. They are growing <i>ghastly wan and weak</i>.
Even he, 12, had begun to think of home and, in spite of himself,
tears, 13 (for is not this suggested in “a spray of salt
wave”?) washed his swarthy cheek. Hence now, his question
is more definite. He seeks to “pin” the admiral down to
a fixed time, 14. He gives him until <i>dawn</i> to see land. But
the admiral, feeling that each dawn sees him <i>nearer to the goal</i>
of his heart’s desire, and impatient that the foolish fears and
unreasoning terrors of his men should even threaten the possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
thwarting of this desire, replies sternly, impatiently and
somewhat fiercely, 15. He shall say at break of day, land or
no land, fears or no fears, <i>but one thing</i>, and he puts such emphasis
upon it that no one can misunderstand.</p>

<p>Here, again, pause. Let this firm determination “seep” into
the minds of the hearers. A few moments is long enough, but
to speed on immediately to the fourth stanza is to lose a striking
effect. Then, in perfectly natural, quiet voice, continue
the story: <i>They sailed</i>. 16. Observe the repetition of this
statement. Why is it repeated? A thoughtful author doesn’t
repeat for nothing. Here, by the repetition, 17, Joaquin
Miller seeks powerfully to impress upon his reader that after
they had sailed a long, long way further, they <i>still</i> sailed on.
Hence, is it not apparent there must be quite a little pause between
the first “they sailed” and the second? Try the effect
of this and see the result.</p>

<p>Now, 18, the mate, forced by his own and his sailors’ fears,
though assured of the displeasure of the admiral at his voicing
of these fears, braves his anger by calling his attention to the
coming storm on the sea, 19, and he becomes more agitated
as he expresses his own fears, 20. Yet he knows the courage
of the admiral, and consciously or unconsciously pays him the
tribute of bravery. At the same time, as hope has almost
fled from the bosoms of himself and his shipmates he asks the
question, pleadingly, agonizingly: “<i>What shall we</i>, 22, <i>do when
hope is gone</i>?” In the answer all of Columbus’s exasperation,
despair, determination, are compressed. Has he studied,
prayed, pleaded, striven for years, and come thus far to be
balked by the fears of a few craven cowards? Is he <i>now</i>, just
now, when success must be close within his reach, to fail?
No! by the Eternal, he shall not fail! The childish cries of
his men shall not avail. He will compel them to go on, and,
as though he were maddened beyond control his words “leap
like a leaping sword,” 23, and cleave the air with ringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
sound that strikes down all opposition, <i>Sail on!</i> <i>Sail on!</i> <span class="smcap">sail
on!</span> AND ON!</p>

<p>Let the crescendo come with all the power, force, voice, of
which you are capable. Prepare for it. Get the lungs full of
air. Put all the intensity and passion of a lifetime’s hopes,
desires, ambitions, into it, and feel as though you had these
cowardly sailors by the throat and were determined upon pouring
your will into their craven souls.</p>

<p>Again pause, before going to the last stanza. Elbert Hubbard
and his wife, both of whom were public speakers and
readers of high order, regarded this sixth stanza as an anticlimax.
Personally, I do not. Properly given, it is a most
powerful climax to a most powerful poem. Ask yourself:
After the expression of an overwhelming emotion, what natural
reaction is felt? One of weariness. Add this thought
to the thoughts expressed in the words. Long and endless
vigils, harassment from his men, <i>doubts in his own soul</i>, which,
however, he dare not voice. 25. That night was so dark because,
crushed by long-continued opposition, and his body
weakened by constant watchfulness, and the urge of his passion,
even <i>he lost hope</i>. But thanks be to God, there are men
like Columbus, who, even when hope seems gone, when there
is no light whatever in “<i>that night of all dark nights</i>” still persist.
For, is it not darkest just before dawn? Suddenly our
minds are transferred to the lookout man. He sees a speck.
26. Wonderingly he looks at it again and again, until he is
assured it is a light, so he gives the warning cry: “A light!”
27. Now notice the repetition of the word light. Four times
it appears. Why? Most critics account such repetitions as
proofs of an author’s weakness, but they little know Joaquin
Miller who so regard his repetitions. Let your brain work
awhile. Remember, Columbus and his sailors have been weeks
away from land, sailing on unknown, uncharted seas. They
are becoming used to seeing no land, nothing but seas upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
which even the winds have lost their way. Yet the lookout
sees a light. He satisfies himself. He gives the signal call:
“A light!” For dramatic purposes we can imagine that every
one on the vessel hears it. Incredulously they call out a query:
“A light?” It cannot be! But, sure of himself, and seeing
it more clearly each moment, the lookout assertingly replies,
“A light! I tell you!” Then, all doubt removed, filled with
joy, their fears dispersed, their bodings and apprehensions removed,
the sailors hysterically and joyously unite in the cry:
“A light!” and the reason for the four “a lights!” is made clear.</p>

<p>Now, the poet, 28, changes the thought and rapidly introduces
figures of speech. The light on the first land seen by
Columbus ultimately grows to the “starlit flag of freedom” of
the United States, the flag of the people, the flag of a true
republic, the flag of genuine democracy. But it grew further,
29. That light, and that flag, grew to be “Time’s burst of
dawn.” In other words, until all men, everywhere, in every
way, are <i>free</i>, mankind is still in the night. The dawn comes
only when men can be themselves, as God intended they should
when he created them. Hence triumphant joy should be expressed
in speaking of this flag, and what it means to the world.</p>

<p>Then, calmly, quietly, bring the mind back to the admiral.
What did he gain? 30. “A world.” And he gave that world
its grandest lesson, that of persistence in following the vision
of the higher and larger things, <i>On, Sail on!</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Suggestive Outline for the Study of a Selection</span></h4>

<h5>I. <i>Mastery of Main Theme</i></h5>

<p>The first step in the study of any selection is to gain an idea
of it as a whole. This can best be done by reading the selection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
in its entirety. If there should be strange words, let them
pass for the time being. Thus we grasp the predominant mood
and significant setting or situation.</p>

<h5>II. <i>Progressive Analysis</i></h5>

<p>Read the selection, silently, a second time. The aim now is
to make a mental note of the several parts which make up the
whole. This demands close concentration, in order that we
may unify matters and prevent abrupt transitions. We are to
break up the whole into parts, and each part represents a
thought group.</p>

<p>1. Punctuation makes the meaning clear, and the clear meaning
determines the various groups. Example: “It came,
rushing in torrents like an avalanche of rock.” We do not
pause after “came,” although it is so punctuated. Question:
Do you find like instances in the selection under consideration?
Where?</p>

<p>2. The length and frequency of the <i>pause</i> which sets off the
groups is dependent upon the context and upon the listeners.
If the context is serious, or if the listeners are uneducated,
there will of necessity be many groups. And obversely, if the
context is not serious or difficult, or if the audience is educated,
there will be fewer and longer groups.</p>

<p>Question: What is the situation in the present selection?</p>

<p>3. In the study of the chief word in the group we must remember
that its real meaning depends upon its relation to the
other words in the same group. For instance, the word “fire”
does not mean the same thing at all times. The meaning of
this word depends upon its kinship with other members of the
same group. When we say, “The house is on fire,” this word
“fire” means an altogether different thing than when we say,
“There is a fire in the stove this morning.” Let us take care
that we do not isolate words, but that we get their associative
meanings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Questions: What are the important words in the various
groups? What is the real meaning of each? Why? Give
five synonyms of each.</p>

<h5>III. <i>Reference to Experience</i></h5>

<p>We are now prepared to call upon our storehouse of past
experiences in order that we may identify ourselves more
closely with the author’s meaning. We are to react upon what
we read. The more vividly we can bring what we read from
the page into our own actual experience, the more deeply are
we impressed with its meaning. We translate the unseen, the
unfelt and unbelieved by likening it to what is already seen, felt
or believed. If experience is lacking, we draw upon our imagination.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. If we are reading a description, we will see this scene in
terms of a past like experience.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. If we are reading a narration, we will feel it in terms of
a past like experience.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. If we are reading something we have not believed, we
will accept it in terms of what we have already believed.</p>

</div>

<p>Question: What experiences does this selection call upon
from me? What purposes do they serve?</p>

<h5>IV. <i>Classification</i></h5>

<p>There are three divisions into which all selections may be
put. A selection may be written to make something <span class="smcap">Clear</span>;
it may be for the purpose of inspiring, or elevating one’s
thoughts and feelings—to make <span class="smcap">Impressive</span>; it may be for the
purpose of enforcing some great truth—to make <span class="smcap">Belief</span>. This
classification is based upon the author’s purpose.</p>

<p>Questions: Where the author’s purpose is to make <span class="smcap">Clear</span>
some obscure point or idea.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. What significant words are used?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Is there any obscurity? Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">3. What illustrations or comparisons are made?</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Think earnestly of an experience which will aid you to
see clearly the author’s purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>Where the author’s purpose is <span class="smcap">Impressiveness</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Is the emotion aroused pleasurable?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Have you had an experience which resembles what is
referred to?</p>

<p class="hanging">3. What mood is predominant? Is it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impassioned, grave, sad,</li>
<li>Triumphant, exalted, solemn,</li>
<li>Humorous, satirical, pathetic,</li>
<li>Inspiring, enheartening, discouraging?</li>
</ul>

<p class="hanging">4. What are the minor moods? Supply your own descriptive
mood if none of the following are adequate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fanciful, enthusiastic, cheerful,</li>
<li>Dreamy, sentimental, witty,</li>
<li>Pensive, tender, serene, quiet,—or suggestive of</li>
<li>Awe, loneliness,</li>
<li>Admiration, suspense, joy, anger,</li>
<li>Fear, rage, sympathy, grief, sorrow, surprise, anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Where the author’s purpose is <span class="smcap">Belief</span>. The author does
more than make us see, or feel.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. What actual experience have you had that resembles
the thing the author would have you believe?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Do you accept as truth what you have read?</p>

<p class="hanging">3. What particular thought carries the most conviction?</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Do you think others should believe what the author
says?</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Is it clear and impressive, and do you believe it?</p>

</div>

<h5>V. <i>Setting</i></h5>

<p>This has to do with time, place, objects, sounds, movement,
or anything that gives local color to the selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Is it modern or old?</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Where is the scene laid?</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Are descriptions given in detail or mere suggestion?</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Is dialect used?</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Will personation aid in rendering the selection?</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Does the power and beauty of the selection lie in narration,
description, or in character drawing?</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Name some definite things, sounds or objects described,
that give color or atmosphere.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Is the movement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow, swift, light, heavy,</li>
<li>Tripping, graceful, spirited,</li>
<li>Powerful, easy, varied?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5>VI. <i>Vocalization</i></h5>

<p>Let our guide be as Shakespeare has so well put it:</p>

<p>Let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word;
the word to the action; with this special observance—that you o’erstep
not the modesty of nature.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Read the selection as ordinary conversation.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Now read again as enlarged conversation, or, as it were,
for the ears of many.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Do I make proper use of Pitch?</li>
<li>(2) Do I make proper use of Pause?</li>
<li>(3) Do I make proper use of Inflection?</li>
<li>(4) Do I make proper use of Tone Color?</li>
<li>(5) Do I make proper use of Stress?</li>
<li>(6) Do I make proper use of Movement?</li>
</ul>

<p class="hanging">4. At all times let us remember that our purpose is not to
give a pleasing performance, but faithfully to interpret
the author’s meaning.</p>

<p>Read silently the entire selection. The purpose is to gain an
impression of the selection as a whole.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. What was the author’s purpose in writing this selection?</p>

<h6>A. <i>General Preparation</i></h6>

<p>Before rendering a selection orally it must be given a setting.

<h6>B. <i>Special Preparation</i></h6>

<p>Read the selection aloud for the first time. In doing this,
ask yourself:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Am I reading with correct thought-groups?</p>

<h5>THE JOY OF READING</h5>

<p>Who can estimate the joy, comfort and inspiration reading has afforded
to the human race, how many weary hours it has solaced, how
many distracted minds it has quieted, how many harassed souls it has
soothed into forgetfulness? Who has not felt the thrill of discovery
when he has found a new author, a new poet who peculiarly affected
his mind, his soul, his risibilities, his ambitions, his life? I shall never
forget when I found Charles Warren Stoddard’s “Apostrophe to a
Skylark.” It was buried in one of his books and few seemed ever to
have read it. There was joy incalculable in putting it side by side with
Shelley’s classic “Ode” and comparing the two conceptions. Thousands
of souls have been inspired by reading to higher, nobler, more worthy
endeavor. So, like Sancho Panza, we bless God and thank Him for
the man who invented reading.</p>

<h5>NATHAN FOSTER</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Paul L. Dunbar</span></p>

<p>Nathan Foster and his lifelong friend and neighbor, Silas Bollender,
sat together side by side upon the line-fence that separated their respective
domains. They were both whittling away industriously, and there
had been a long silence between them. Nathan broke it, saying:</p>

<p>“’Pears to me like I’ve had oncommon good luck this year.”</p>

<p>“Wall, you have had good luck, there ain’t no denyin’ that. It ’pears
as though you’ve been ee-specially blest.”</p>

<p>“An’ I know I ain’t done nothin’ to deserve it.”</p>

<p>“No, o’ course not. Don’t take no credit to yourself, Nathan. We
don’t none of us deserve our blessings, however we may feel about
our crosses; we kin be purty shore o’ that.”</p>

<p>“Now, look, my pertater vines was like little trees, an’ nary a bug
on ’em.”</p>

<p>“An’ you had as good a crop of corn as I’ve ever seen raised in this
part of Montgomery county.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I sold it, too, jest before that big drop in the price.”</p>

<p>“After givin’ away all yer turnips you could, you had to feed ’em to
the hogs.”</p>

<p>“My fruit trees jest had to be propped up, an’ I’ve got enough perserves
in my cellar to last two or three winters, even takin’ into consideration
the drain o’ church socials an’ o’ charity.”</p>

<p>“Yore chickens are fat and sassy, not a sign o’ pip on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Look at them cows in the fur pastur. Did yer ever see anything to
beat ’em fer sleekness?”</p>

<p>“Wall, look at the pasture itself; it’s most enough to make human
beings envy the critters. You didn’t have a drop of rain on yer while
you was gettin’ in yer hay, did yer?”</p>

<p>“Not a drop.”</p>

<p>“An’ I had a whole lot ruined jest as I was about to rick it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“Silas, sich luck as I’m a-havin’ is achilly skeery; it don’t seem right.”</p>

<p>“No, it don’t seem right for a religious man like you, Nathan. Ef
you was a hard an’ graspin’ Sinner, it ’ud be jest makin’ you top-heavy
so’s yore fall ’ud be the greater.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what that’s it, anyhow. Mebbe I’m a-gettin’ puffed
up over my goods without exactly knowin’ it.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, mebbe so. Them kind o’ feelin’s is mighty sneakin’
comin’ on a body. O’ course I ain’t seen no signs of it in you; but
it ’pears to me you’ll have to mortify yore flesh yit to keep from being
purse-proud.”</p>

<p>“Mortify the flesh?”</p>

<p>“O’ course, you can’t put peas in yore shoes er get any of yer frien’s
to lash you, so you’ll have to find some other way of mortifyin’ yer
flesh. Wall, fer my part, I don’t need to look fur none, fur I never
had too many blessin’s in my life, less’n you’d want to put the children
under that head.”</p>

<p>Silas shut his jack-knife with a snap and, laughing, slid down on his
side of the fence. In serious silence Nathan Foster watched him go
stumping up the path toward the house.</p>

<p>“Silas seems to take everything so light in this world; I wonder
how he can do it.”</p>

<p>With Nathan, now, it was just the other way. Throughout his eight
and forty years he had taken every fact of life with ponderous seriousness.
Entirely devoid of humor, he was a firm believer in signs, omens,
tokens, and judgments. He was a religious man, and his wealth
frightened and oppressed him. He gave to his church and gave freely.</p>

<p>As usual, he had taken his friend’s bantering words in hard earnest
and was turning them over in his mind.</p>

<p>The next morning when Nathan and Silas met to compare notes,
Nathan began:</p>

<p>“I have been thinking over what you said last night, Silas, about me
mortifyin’ my flesh, and it seems to me like a good idee. I wrasselled
in prayer last night, and it was shown to me that it wa’n’t no more’n
right fur me to make some kind o’ sacrifice fur the mercies that’s been
bestowed upon me.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I don’t know, Nathan; burnt-offerings are a little out now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean nothin’ like that; I mean some sacrifice of myself,
some—”</p>

<p>His sentence was broken in upon by a shrill voice that called from
Silas Bollender’s kitchen door:</p>

<p>“Si, you’d better be a-gittin’ about yore work instid o’ standin’ over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
there a-gassin’ all the mornin’. I’m shore I don’t have no time to stand
around.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mollie; speakin’ of mortifyin’ the flesh an’ makin’ a sacrifice
of yoreself, Nathan, why don’t you git married?”</p>

<p>Nathan started.</p>

<p>“Then you’d be shore to accomplish both. Fur pure mortification of
the flesh, I don’t know of nothin’ more thoroughgoin’ er effectiver
than a wife. Also she is a vexation to a man’s sperit. You raaly
ought to git married, Nathan.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“It looks to me that that ’ud be about as good a sacrifice as you
could make; an’ then it’s such a lastin’ one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you realize what you air a-sayin’, Silas. It’s a
mighty desprit step that you’re advisin’ me to take.”</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Bollender’s voice broke in:</p>

<p>“Si, air you goin’ to git anything done this mornin’, er air you goin’
to stand there an’ hold up that fence fur the rest of the day?”</p>

<p>“Nathan, kin you stand here an’ listen to a voice an’ a speech like
that an’ then ask me if I realize the despritness of marriage?”</p>

<p>“It’s desprit, but who’d you advise me to marry,—Silas, that is, if I
made up my mind to marry,—an’ I don’t jest see any other way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t pickin’ out wives fur anybody, but it seems to me that
you might be doin’ a good turn by marryin’ the Widder Young. The
Lord ’ud have two special reasons fur blessin’ you then; fur you’d be
mortifyin’ yore flesh an’ at the same time a-helpin’ the widder an’ her
orphans.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” He couldn’t admit to Silas that he had been thinking
hard of the Widow Young even before he had of mortifying his flesh
with a wife.</p>

<p>Once decided, it did not take him long to put his plans into execution.
But he called Silas over to the fence that evening after he had
dressed to pay a visit to the widow.</p>

<p>“Wall, Silas, I’ve determined to take the step you advised.”</p>

<p>“Humph, you made your mind up in a hurry, Nathan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it’s any use a-waiting; ef a thing’s to be done,
I think it ought to be done and got through with. What I want
particular to know now is, whether it wouldn’t be best to tell
Lizzie—I mean the widder—that I want her as a means of mortification.”</p>

<p>“Wall, no, Nathan, I don’t know as I would do that jest yit; I don’t
believe it would be best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“But if she don’t know, wouldn’t it be obtainin’ her under false pretenses
if she said yes?”</p>

<p>“Not exactaly the way I look at it, fur you’ve got more motives fur
marryin’ than one.”</p>

<p>“What! Explain yoreself, Silas; explain yoreself.”</p>

<p>“I mean you want to do her good as well as subdue your own
sperit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s so.”</p>

<p>“Now, no woman wants to know at first that she’s a vexation to a
man’s sperit. It sounds scriptual, but it don’t sound nooptial. Now
look at me an’ Mis’ Bollender. I never told her until we’d been married
more’n six months; but she didn’t believe it then, an’ she won’t
believe it till this day.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll agree not to tell her right away, but if she consents, I
must tell her a week or so after we are married. It’ll ease my conscience.
Ef I could tell her now, it ’ud be a heap easier in gittin’ round
the question. I don’t know jest how to do it without.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t have no trouble in makin’ her understand. Matrimony’s
a subject that women air mighty keen on. They can see if a
man’s a-poppin’ the question ef he only half tries. You’ll git through
all right.”</p>

<p>Somewhat strengthened, Nathan left his friend and sought the
widow’s home. He found her stitching away merrily under the light
of a coal-oil lamp with a red shade.</p>

<p>“La, Nathan, who’d a’ expected to see you up here? You’ve got to
be such a home body that no one don’t look to see you out of yore
own field and garden.”</p>

<p>“I jest thought I’d drop in.”</p>

<p>“Wall, it’s precious kind of you, I’m shore. I was a-feelin’ kind o’
lonesome. The children go to bed with the chickens.”</p>

<p>“I jest thought I’d drop in.”</p>

<p>“Wall, it does remind me of old times to see you jest droppin’ in,
informal like, this way. My, how time does fly!”</p>

<p>“Widder, I’ve been thinkin’ a good deal lately; I’ve been greatly
prospered in my day; in fact, my cup runneth over.”</p>

<p>“You have been prospered, Nathan.”</p>

<p>“Seems ’s ef—seems ’s ef I ought to sheer it with somebody,
don’t it?”</p>

<p>“Wall, Nathan, I don’t know nobody that’s more generous in givin’
to the pore than you air.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean in jest exactly that way. I mean, widder—you’re the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
morti—I mean the salvation of my soul. Could you—would you—er
do you think you’d keer to sheer my blessin’s with me an’ add another
one to ’em?”</p>

<p>The Widow Young looked at him in astonishment; then the tears
filled her eyes as she asked, “Nathan, do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t a-spent so much trouble on a joke, widder.”</p>

<p>“No, it don’t seem that you would, Nathan. Well, it’s mighty sudden,
mighty sudden, but I can’t say no.”</p>

<p>“Fur these an’ many other blessin’s make us truly thankful, O Lord,”
said Nathan devoutly. And he sat another hour with the widow making
plans for the early marriage, on which he insisted.</p>

<p>The widow had been settled in Nathan’s home over a month before
he had ever thought of telling her of the real motive of his marriage,
and every day from the time it occurred to him it grew harder for him
to do it.</p>

<p>One night when he had been particularly troubled he sought his
friend and counselor with a clouded brow. They sat together in their
accustomed place on the fence.</p>

<p>“I’m bothered, Silas.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s several things. First off, I ain’t never told the widder
that she was a mortification, an’ next she ain’t. I look around at that
old house o’ mine that ain’t been a home since mother used to scour
the hearth, an’ it makes me feel like singin’ fer joy. An’ I hear them
children playin’ round me—they’re the beatenest children; that youngest
one called me daddy yistiddy—well, I see ’em playin’ round and
my eyes air opened, an’ I see that the widder’s jest another blessin’
added to the rest. It looks to me like I had tried to beat the
Almighty.”</p>

<p>“Wall, now, Nathan, I don’t know that you’ve got any cause to feel
bothered. You’ve done yore duty. If you’ve tried to mortify yore
flesh an’ it refused to mortify, why, that’s all you could do, an’ I
believe the Lord’ll take the will fer the deed an’ credit you accordin’ly.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, Silas, mebbe so.”</p>

<h5>DOING A WOMAN’S WORK</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By McKillip-Stanwood</span></p>

<p>“Breakfast ready yet?” asked Jack Telfer, as he set two pails of
foaming milk on the bench and turned to wash his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Almost,” replied his wife. “But, say, Jack, won’t you fix the calf
pen while you’re waiting? It won’t take but a minute. The calves
got out twice yesterday and tramped all over the flower beds and garden.
I had an awful time getting them in. I tried to fix it, but I
don’t think I did a good job.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stop now. I guess it’s all right. If they get out, why
chase them in; you have nothing else to do, and I’ll fix it up right
when I get time. I want my breakfast now. I can’t fool around here
till noon. I’ve got to cultivate the peaches to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing else to do,” repeated his wife, as she dished up the
tempting breakfast. “Well, I like that, Jack Telfer. I wish to goodness
I hadn’t any more to do than you have.”</p>

<p>“Why, what under the sun have you to do? You have only Toodles
and me to look after and this little house to keep. I could do all the
work you do with one hand tied behind me and then find time to
throw at the birds. You see, I know what I am talking about, for I
can cook and do housework as well as any woman.”</p>

<p>“You’ve never displayed any talent in that direction since I’ve known
you. It’s like pulling teeth to get you to do a chore around the house.
Not that I want a man to do housework, for I don’t; that’s a woman’s
business. But when she has every step to take and a dozen things to
do at once, a little help occasionally comes mighty handy.”</p>

<p>“Well, the reason I don’t help around here is because there isn’t
much to do. The work you have is a snap, my girl, and a mighty
soft one, too. Why, my mother had nine children and did all her own
work and cooked for harvest hands and threshers and used to help
the neighbors out if they got in a pinch.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear husband, I do not doubt but your mother was a very
smart woman. She must have been to have raised so promising a son.
But women are not all alike, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Now, your work is a sort of paper-flower work compared with
what I have to do. It would be a picnic for me to stay in the house,
wash dishes, play with the baby and do such things.”</p>

<p>“All right, suppose you have a picnic to-day. I can drive the cultivator
just as well as you and you can cook and keep house a great deal
better than I; at least you think you can. I’ll hitch up and cultivate
the peaches and you can tie one hand behind you and do the work
to-day and see how much time you have to throw at the birds. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Say,” laughed Mr. Telfer as he pushed back from the table. “Why,
I say I’m willing, but if you don’t get enough riding in the hot sun—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“The hot sun,” interrupted his wife, “is no worse than the hot stove
I cook over. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll do it, but you must tell me what’s to be done so you
can’t throw it up to me for ever after that the reason I got through
so soon was because I didn’t do half the work.”</p>

<p>“First,” said Mrs. Telfer, “there’s the milk to skim and the calves to
feed and the churning to do. Skim the milk on the north shelf in
the cellar; the dishes to wash, and don’t forget to scald the churn and
the milk things. Then you can iron; the clothes are all dampened
down in the basket. You need not iron any but the plain things, I’ll
do the others. Pit the cherries I picked last night and make a pie for
dinner. And, oh, yes, you will have to kill a chicken and dress it, for
you know you said last night you wanted chicken and dumplings for
dinner to-day, and now is your chance.</p>

<p>“Stew some prunes for supper to-night, make the bed, sweep and
dust and get the vegetables ready for dinner. Oh, I guess you know
about what there is to do. I must be off now, for it is nearly 6
o’clock.” And she was gone.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s early yet; guess I’ll smoke and read the Rural World
awhile. There’s an article on hogs I wanted to read; it seems nice to
have time to do what you please.”</p>

<p>After he had read a long time he at last knocked the ashes into his
hand and stretched lazily.</p>

<p>He went down cellar and skimmed the milk, then he fed the calves,
laughed at the way his wife had tried to fix the calf pen, went in and
took off the table cloth and piled the dishes and empty milk things on
the table.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll wash up before I churn. No, I won’t, either. I’ll churn
first; then I’ll clean up all at once. Oh, I’ve got a head on me. I
ought to have been a woman.”</p>

<p>He brought from the cellar a large new pan of thick cream and set
it on the table, then he went to scald the churn, but the fire was out
and the dish water Mrs. Telfer had put on before breakfast was
nearly cold.</p>

<p>“Blame it all, I’ve got to go to the barn for peach pits; not one in
the basket. But I’ll kill the chicken while I’m out there and save an
extra trip. If Jennie would only use some management about her work
she’d have plenty of time.”</p>

<p>The large pit basket was soon filled, but the chicken was another
proposition. Every time he selected one to catch it seemed to know
it was a marked bird and would shy off to the edge of the flock. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
last he had to run one down, and he wrung its neck with a great deal
of satisfaction. As he entered the house the clock struck nine.</p>

<p>“Wheu! Where has the morning gone? I must get a move on me.
Guess I’ll make the pie first so it can bake while the water is heating.”</p>

<p>He prepared the cherries. Then he made the pie; made it as well
as a woman could. He had pushed the dishes back on the cluttered
table to make room for his bread-board, and just as he had the crust
nicely stamped down around the edge of his pie, with a fork, a tousled
head of yellow curls appeared in the doorway, one chubby hand holding
up a long, white nighty, the other rubbing a sleepy eye.</p>

<p>There was surprise on the baby face at the sight of his father.
Papa meant fun for Toodles, and, running to him, he put up his little
arms, saying, “Papa, high me; high Toodles, papa; high Toodles.”
And his father, dusting the flour from his hands, tossed the baby to
the ceiling again and again while the little fellow screamed with delight.</p>

<p>In the midst of this jolly frolic the clock announced that it was the
tenth hour of the day.</p>

<p>“Hear that, young man?” said the father. “That means that we must
cut out this racket and get down to business. Your paternal ancestor is
chief cook and general manager to-day and has several little chores to
do yet. We will get Toodles’ breakfast first, then wash and dress him
afterwards so that he won’t get mussed up when he eats.</p>

<p>“Mamma don’t do that way, but we can give mamma a few pointers
on keeping a baby clean, can’t we, Toodles?”</p>

<p>And, putting the child in his high-chair, Mr. Telfer pinned a tea
towel around the little neck for a bib, took a bowl and went to the
cellar for some new milk.</p>

<p>While Toodles was eating breakfast his father washed the prunes
and put them on to stew, set the pie in the oven and started to build
the fire, but he was interrupted by an emphatic voice saying, “Papa,
down; papa, down.”</p>

<p>“All right, young man, I’ll attend to your case directly,” said Jack,
touching a match to the kindling. “Guess I’ll wash and dress you and
have you off my hands.”</p>

<p>And, taking a wash-pan of tepid water, with soap, comb, rag, towel
and Toodles, he went into the sitting-room where it was cool and
pleasant. The baby’s clean clothes were lying upon a chair, where his
mamma had placed them the night before. Then what a time they had.
Toodles would catch the wash rag in his teeth and papa would shake
it and growl till the little mouth would have to let loose to scream with
the agonizing fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Then came the tangled curls, and it took a wonderful story about a
doggie that would say “Bow, wow,” and a little horsie that Toodles
could ride and a chicky that went “Peep, peep, peep,” and several other
mental concoctions to keep the baby quiet until the ringlets were in
order.</p>

<p>When the clean coaties were on and two little arms hugged papa
tight, Jack Telfer thought, “Jennie calls this work.”</p>

<p>The clock pounded out eleven strokes.</p>

<p>“Blast that clock; what’s got into it,” thought the man, putting the
child down and hurrying to the kitchen. “I’ve been busy every minute
this morning, and here it is 11 o’clock and not a thing done yet.”</p>

<p>He found the fire had burned out; he had forgotten to put
the peach pits on the kindling when he had stopped to fuss with
Toodles.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll make it all right by noon,” he soliloquized. “This
is a hurry-up order, but I’ll be on time or eat my hat.”</p>

<p>He looked at his pie; it was nearly half baked. He built a roaring
fire, packed the stove with peach pits, pulled the prunes to the front
where they would cook quicker, and was debating in his mind which
he should scald first, the churn or the chicken, when something rushed
by the door.</p>

<p>“Drat those calves; they’re out again.”</p>

<p>Snatching his hat, he hurried after them. It was a merry chase for
the calves if not for Mr. Telfer. They were willing to go in any
direction but the right one, and by the time he got them corralled Jack
was hot, tired and cross.</p>

<p>When Toodles was left alone he started out on a tour of inspection.
The first objects of interest were the dead chicken and the peach-pit
basket, but his attention was soon detracted from these by the bright
pan that held the cream; it had been pushed to the edge of the table.
As Toodles approached it he saw the reflection of a chubby baby face
on the outside.</p>

<p>“Baby,” said Toodles. He smiled and the pan baby smiled, and he
concluded that the pan must be full of pretty, smiling babies, and he
wanted them to play with. He could just get his little fingers over the
edge of the pan. He pulled and tugged with all his might to get the
pan baby down.</p>

<p>He succeeded, for the pan toppled over and deluged the immaculate
Toodles with thick, yellow cream. His pretty curls were filled with
chunks of oily coagulation, and cream ran in rivulets down his little
back and bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>He seated himself in the middle of it and paddled and spattered in
great glee.</p>

<p>The calf pen took longer to fix than Jack had expected, and as he
neared the house he heard the clock striking twelve, and, looking fieldward,
he saw his wife coming to dinner.</p>

<p>“Jumping Jupiter! what will she say?” was his mental comment.
“But she will soon fix things, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>As he entered the kitchen what a sight met his gaze. The room was
dark with smoke from burned prunes, the table piled full of unwashed
pans and dishes. The cream. Heavens, the cream! The dead chicken
lay in the middle of the floor and the pit-basket was upset, as Toodles
had left it for the pan baby. The open-mouthed churn stared at him.</p>

<p>Mr. Telfer opened the oven door; his pie was a black mass.</p>

<p>“I can see now why women sit down and cry sometimes. I’m
blessed if I don’t feel like it myself,” he said.</p>

<p>Toodles, drenched but happy, called from the middle of his cream
puddle, “High me, papa; high me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Telfer called out as she passed the house: “Hello! Dinner
ready? I’m awful hungry.” But her husband was not visible.</p>

<p>She had enjoyed her morning’s work and was in excellent spirits.
She watered and fed the team, then started for the house. The novelty
of the situation amused her. She expected Jack would have some
surprise ready, some extra dish for dinner, the table decorated with
flowers or, perhaps, be tricked out in one of her white aprons with
his hair curled and a pink ribbon around his neck to show how a wife
should greet her husband.</p>

<p>He was such a wag it was impossible to tell what he might do. As
she entered the house she stood dumb with amazement. Her eyes took
in the situation. The breakfast dishes, the burned pie, the creamy
Toodles, the dead chicken, the littered sitting-room with the remains
of Toodles’ toilet and the distracted-looking man.</p>

<p>“How soon will dinner be ready?” she asked. But her husband did
not answer; he was busy picking up peach pits. “I’ve got to get back
to work as soon as I can,” she continued.</p>

<p>Crossing the room, she took up a paper and went outside and sat
down in the shade to read.</p>

<p>Toodles, greasy and dripping, trotted after.</p>

<p>“Oh, baby, go to papa and get cleaned up. Go tell papa to clean
baby up, darling,” said his mother. And the little fellow hurried into
the house, saying: “Keen baby up, papa; keen baby up.”</p>

<p>Poor Jack, he had lost out. He was hopelessly balled up. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
mad. He had felt somehow that his troubles were over when he saw
his wife coming, but when she took the paper and sat down to read,
leaving him in that awful muss, the iron entered his soul.</p>

<p>Yet he knew that was exactly the way he did, and only yesterday
when she asked him to get a pitcher of fresh water for dinner he
had said:</p>

<p>“It’s a pity a man can’t get a moment to rest without having to
chore around the house.”</p>

<p>“Keen baby up, papa; keen baby up!” reiterated Toodles. Jack
looked down at the greasy, smeary child with its cream-matted curls
and capitulated.</p>

<p>“Say, Jennie,” he called, “I’ll give up. I know when I’m worsted.
It’s my treat. If you’ll come in here and help me out of this mix-up
you can name your own price and I’ll pay it. I’ve worked all the
morning and haven’t done a blamed thing but get all balled up. I
never would have believed a woman had so much to do if I hadn’t tried
it. I am dead sore at the whole deal.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jack,” laughed his wife, as she came to his assistance, “you
don’t seem to like paper-flower work. I guess you forgot to tie one
hand behind you and so used both to throw time at the birds.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, Jennie, don’t strike a man when he’s down. I’ll
admit that I’m not nearly so smart as I thought I was this morning,
but how things ever got in this shape I can’t tell,” said Jack with a
grim smile.</p>

<p>Together they soon brought order out of chaos, and as they sat
eating their picked-up dinner Jack said:</p>

<p>“If it is all the same to you, Jennie, I’ll finish the orchard this
afternoon.”—<i>The Los Angeles Times.</i></p>

<h5>A BAD NIGHT</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. Ross Browne</span></p>

<p>I gradually dropped off into a doze, a mere doze, for I scorn the
charge of having slept a wink that night. The grating of the grindstones,
the everlasting clatter of tongues, the dust, the chaff, smoke, and
fleas, to say nothing of the roar of the water down below, were enough
to banish all hope of sleep; I merely closed my eyes to try how ridiculous
it would feel. How long they remained closed I scarcely know;
it was not long, however, for I soon heard a heavy breathing close by
my head, and felt the warm breath of some monster on my face. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
knew it to be no Arab; it blew and snuffed altogether unlike anything
of the human kind. Thinking it might be all fancy, I cautiously put
out my hand in the dark and began to feel around me. For some
moments I could discover nothing, but in waving my hand around I
at length touched something—something that sent the blood flying
back to my heart a good deal quicker than it ever flew before. To tell
the honest truth, I never was so startled in all the previous adventures
of my life. The substance that I put my hand on was bare and warm;
it was wet also and slimy, and had large nostrils which seemed to be
in the act of smelling me, previous to the act of mastication. With the
quickness of lightning I jerked up my hand, and felt it glide along a
skin covered with long rough hair; the next instant my ears were
stunned by the most dreadful noises, which resembled, as I thought in
the horror of the moment, the roaring of a full-grown lion. But it
was not the roaring of a lion; it was only the braying of an ass.—From
<i>The Mill of Malaha</i>.</p>

<h5>AN UNTHANKFUL ORPHAN</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Kate Langley Bosher</span></p>

<p>My name is Mary Cary. I live in the Yorkburg Female Orphan
Asylum. You may think nothing happens in an Orphan Asylum. It
does. The orphans are sure enough children, and real, much like the
kind that have Mothers and Fathers; but though they don’t give parties
or wear truly Paris clothes, things happen.</p>

<p>To-day I was kept in. Yesterday, too. I don’t mind, for I would
rather watch the lightning up here than be down in the basement with
the others. There are days when I love thunder and lightning. I
can’t flash and crash, being just Mary Cary; but I’d like to, and when
it is done for me it is a relief to my feelings.</p>

<p>The reason I was kept in was this: Yesterday Mr. Gaffney, the one
with a sunk eye and cold in his head perpetual, came to talk to us for
the benefit of our characters. He thinks it’s his duty, and, just naturally
loving to talk, he wears us out once a week anyhow. Yesterday,
not agreeing with what he said, I wouldn’t pretend I did, and I
was punished prompt, of course.</p>

<p>I don’t care for duty-doers, and I tried not to listen to him; but
tiresome talk is hard not to hear—it makes you so mad. Hear him
I did, and when, after he had ambled on until I thought he really was
castor-oil and I had swallowed him, he blew his nose and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“You have much, my children, to be thankful for, and for everything
you should be thankful. Are you? If so, stand up. Rise, and
stand upon your feet.”</p>

<p>I didn’t rise. All the others did—stood on their feet, just like he
asked. None tried their heads. I was the only one that sat, and when
his good eye stared at me in such astonishment, I laughed out loud.
I couldn’t help it, I truly couldn’t.</p>

<p>I’m not thankful for everything, and that’s why I didn’t stand up.
Can you be thankful for toothache, or stomachache, or any kind of
ache? You cannot. And not meant to be, either.</p>

<p>The room got awful still, and then presently he said:</p>

<p>“Mary Cary”—his voice was worse than his eye—“Mary Cary, do
you mean to say you have not a thankful heart?” And he pointed his
finger at me like I was the Jezebel lady come to life.</p>

<p>I didn’t answer, thinking it safer, and he asked again:</p>

<p>“Do I understand, Mary Cary”—and by this time he was real red-in-the-face
mad—“do I understand you are not thankful for all that
comes to you? Do I understand aright?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you understand right,” I said, getting up this time. “I am
not thankful for everything in my life. I’d be much thankfuller to
have a Mother and Father on earth than to have them in heaven.
And there are a great many other things I would like different.” And
down I sat, and was kept in for telling the truth.</p>

<p>Miss Bray says it was for impertinence (Miss Bray is the Head
Chief of this Institution), but I didn’t mean to be impertinent. I truly
didn’t. Speaking facts is apt to make trouble, though—also writing
them. To-day Miss Bray kept me in for putting something on the
blackboard I forgot to rub out. I wrote it just for my own relief, not
thinking about anybody else seeing it. What I wrote was this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some people are crazy all the time;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All people are crazy sometimes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That’s why I’m up in the punishment-room to-day, and it only proves
that what I wrote is right. It’s crazy to let people know you know
how queer they are. Miss Bray takes personal everything I do, and
when she saw that blackboard, up-stairs she ordered me at once. She
loves to punish me, and it’s a pleasure I give her often.</p>

<p>She thinks she could run this earth better than it’s being done, and
she walks around like she is the Superintendent of most of it.</p>

<p>But she’s taught me a good deal about Human Nature, Miss Bray
has. About the side I didn’t know. I think I will make a special study<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
of Human Nature. I thought once I’d take up Botany in particular,
as I love flowers; or Astronomy, so as to find out all about those
million worlds in the sky, so superior to earth, and so much larger;
but I think, now, I’ll settle on Human Nature. Nobody ever knows
what it is going to do, which makes it full of surprises, but there’s a
lot that’s real interesting about it. I like it. As for its Bray side,
I’ll try not to think about it; but if there are puddles, I guess it’s well
to know where, so as not to step in them. I wish we didn’t have to
know about puddles and things! I’d so much rather know little and
be happy than find out the miserable much some people do. God is
going to have a hard time with Miss Bray. She’s right old to change,
and she’s set in her ways—bad ways.</p>

<p>Did you know I wrote poetry? Umhm. I do. Last week I wrote
one. This is it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In the winter, by the fireside, when the snow falls soft and white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am waiting, hoping, longing, but for what I don’t know quite.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when summer’s sunshine shimmers, and the birds sing clear and sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am waiting, always waiting, for the joy I hope to meet.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It will be, I think, my husband, and the home he’ll make for me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But of his coming or home-making, I as yet no signs do see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I still shall keep on waiting, for I know it’s true as fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you really, truly hustle, things will come if just you’ll wait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Miss Bray was to get married. When I grow up I am going to marry
a million-dollar man, so I can travel around the world and have a
house in Paris with twenty bathrooms in it. And I’m going to have
horses and automobiles and a private car and balloons, if they are
working all right by that time. I hope they will be, for I want something
in which I can soar up and sit and look down on other people.</p>

<p>All my life people have looked down on me, passing me by like I
was a Juny bug or a caterpillar, and I don’t wonder. I’m merely Mary
Cary with fifty-eight more just like me. Blue calico, white dots for
winter, white calico, blue dots for summer. Black sailor hats and
white sailor hats with blue capes for cold weather, and no fire to
dress by, and freezing fingers when it’s cold, and no ice-water when
it’s hot.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to marry a rich man. I will try to love him, but if
I can’t I will be polite to him and travel alone as much as possible.
But I am going to be rich some day, I am. And when I come back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
to Yorkburg eyes will bulge, for the clothes I am going to wear will
make mouths water, they’re going to be so grand.</p>

<p>It seems like every time Miss Katherine goes away from the ’Sylum
I’d be bad. Last time she hadn’t been gone two days till I’d invented
more trouble. It was this way: In the summer we have much more
time than in the winter, and the children kept coming to me asking
me to make up something, and all of a sudden a play came in my
mind. I just love acting. The play was to be the marriage of Dr.
Rudd and Miss Bray.</p>

<p>You see, Miss Bray is dead in love with Dr. Rudd—really addled
about him. And whenever he comes to see any of the children who
are sick she is so solitious and sweet and smiley that we call her, to
ourselves, Ipecac Mollie. Other days, plain Mollie Cottontail. It
seemed to me if we could just think him into marrying her, it would
be the best work we’d ever done, and I thought it was worth trying.</p>

<p>They say if you just think and think and think about a thing you
can make somebody else think about it, too. And not liking Dr. Rudd,
we didn’t mind thinking her on him, and so we began. Every day
we’d meet for an hour and think together, and each one promised to
think single, and in between times we got ready.</p>

<p>Becky Drake says love goes hard late in life, and sometimes touches
the brain. Maybe that accounts for Miss Bray.</p>

<p>She is fifty-three years old, and all frazzled out and done up with
adjuncts. But Dr. Rudd, being a man with not even usual sense, and
awful conceited, don’t see what we see, and swallows easy. Men are
funny—funny as some women.</p>

<p>I don’t think he’s ever thought of courting Miss Bray. But she’s
thought of it, and for once we tried to help her, and the play was a
corker; it certainly was. We chose Friday night because Miss Jones
always takes tea with her aunt that night, and Miss Bray goes to
choir practicing. I wish everybody could hear her sing! Gabriel
ought to engage her to wake the dead—only they’d want to die again.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudd is in the choir, and she just lives on having Friday nights
to look forward to.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place in the basement-room where we play in
bad weather. It’s across from the dining-room, the kitchen being between,
and it’s a right nice place to march in, being long and narrow.</p>

<p>I was the preacher, and Prudence Arch and Nita Polley, Emma Clark
and Margaret Witherspoon were the bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Lizzie Wyatt was the bride, and Katie Freeman, who is the tallest
girl in the house, though only fourteen, was the groom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Katie is so thin she would do as well for one thing in this life as
another, so we made her Dr. Rudd.</p>

<p>We didn’t have but two men. Miss Webb says they’re really not
necessary at weddings, except the groom and minister. Nobody notices
them, and, besides, we couldn’t get the pants.</p>

<p>I was an Episcopal minister, so I wouldn’t need any.</p>

<p>If anybody thinks that wedding was slumpy, they think wrong. It
was thrilly. When the bride and groom and the bridesmaids came in,
all the girls were standing in rows on either side of the walls, making
an aisle in between, and they sang a wedding-song I had invented
from my heart.</p>

<p>It was to the Lohengrin tune, which is a little wobbly for words,
but they got them in all right, keeping time with their hands. These
are the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here comes the bride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God save the groom!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And please don’t let any chil-i-il-dren come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For they don’t know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How children feel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor do they know how with children to deal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s still an old maid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though she would not have been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could she have mar-ri-ed any kind of man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But she could not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So to the Humane</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She came, and caus-ed a good deal of pain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But now she’s here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be married, and go</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away with her red-headed, red-bearded beau.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have mercy, Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And help him to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What we’ve been doing this many a year!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And such singing! We’d been practicing in the back part of the yard,
and humming in bed, so as to get the words into the tune; but we
hadn’t let out until that night. That night we let go.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like singing from your heart, and, though I was the
minister and stood on a box which was shaky, I sang too. I led.</p>

<p>The bride didn’t think it was modest to hold up her head, and she
was the only silent one. But the bridegroom and bridesmaids sang,
and it sounded like the revivals at the Methodist church. It was
grand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>And that bride! She was Miss Bray. A graven image of her
couldn’t have been more like her.</p>

<p>She was stuffed in the right places, and her hair was frizzled just
like Miss Bray’s. Frizzled in front, and slick and tight in the back;
and her face was a purple pink, and powdered all over, with a piece
of dough just above her mouth on the left side to correspond with
Miss Bray’s mole.</p>

<p>And she held herself so like her, shoulders back, and making that
little nervous sniffle with her nose, like Miss Bray makes when she’s
excited, that once I had to wink at her to stop.</p>

<p>The groom didn’t look like Dr. Rudd. But she wore men’s clothes,
and that’s the only way you’d know some men were men, and almost
anything will do for a groom. Nobody noticed him.</p>

<p>We were getting on just grand, and I was marrying away, telling
them what they must do and what they mustn’t do. Particularly that
they mustn’t get mad and leave each other, for Yorkburg was very
old-fashioned and didn’t like changes, and would rather stick to its
mistakes than go back on its word. And then I turned to the bride.</p>

<p>“Miss Bray,” I said, “have you told this man you are marrying that
you are two-faced and underhand, and can’t be trusted to tell the
truth? Have you told him that nobody loves you, and that for years
you have tried to pass for a lamb, when you are an old sheep? And
does he know that though you’re a good manager on little and are
not lazy, that your temper’s been ruined by economizing, and that at
times, if you were dead, there’d be no place for you? Peter wouldn’t
pass you, and the devil wouldn’t stand you. And does he know he’s
buying a pig in a bag, and that the best wedding present he could
give you would be a set of new teeth? And will you promise to stop
pink powder and clean your finger-nails every day? And—”</p>

<p>But I got no further, for something made me look up, and there,
standing in the door, was the real Miss Bray.</p>

<h5>A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR A LADY</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Myra Kelly</span></p>

<p>It was the week before Christmas, and the First-Reader Class had,
almost to a man, decided on the gifts to be lavished on “Teacher.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
But Morris Mogilewsky, whose love for Teacher was far greater than
the combined loves of all the other children, had as yet no present to
bestow. The knowledge saddened all his hours and was the more
maddening because it could in no wise be shared by Teacher, who
noticed his altered bearing and tried with all sorts of artful beguilements
to make him happy and at ease. But her efforts served only
to increase his unhappiness and his love. And he loved her! Oh, how
he loved her! Since first his dreading eyes had clung for a breath’s
space to her “like man’s shoes” and had then crept timidly up to her
“light face,” she had been mistress of his heart of hearts. That was
more than three months ago. And well he remembered the day!</p>

<p>His mother had washed him horribly, and had taken him into the
big, red schoolhouse, so familiar from the outside, but so full of unknown
terrors within.</p>

<p>He was then dragged through long halls and up tall stairs by a
large boy, who spoke to him disdainfully as “greenie,” so that his
spirit was quite broken and his nerves were all unstrung when he
was pushed into a room full of bright sunshine and of children who
laughed at his frightened little face. The sunshine smote his timid
eyes, the laughter smote his timid heart, and he turned to flee. But
the door was shut, the large boy gone, and despair took him for its
own.</p>

<p>Down upon the floor he dropped, and wailed, and wept, and kicked.
It was then that he heard, for the first time, the voice which now he
loved.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear little chap, you mustn’t cry like that. What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>The hand was gentle and the question kind, and these, combined
with a faint perfume suggestive of drug-stores and barber-shops—but
nicer than either—made him uncover his hot little face. Kneeling
beside him was a lady, and he forced his eyes to that perilous ascent;
from shoes to skirt, from skirt to jumper, from jumper to face, they
trailed in dread uncertainty, but at the face they stopped. They had
found—rest.</p>

<p>Morris allowed himself to be gathered into the lady’s arms, and
held upon her knee, and when his sobs no longer rent the very foundations
of his pink and wide-spread tie, he answered her question in a
voice as soft as his eyes, and as gently sad.</p>

<p>“I ain’t so big, and I don’t know where is my mamma.”</p>

<p>Thereafter he had been the first to arrive every morning, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
last to leave every afternoon; and under the care of Teacher, his
liege lady, he had grown in wisdom and love and happiness. But the
greatest of these was love. And now, when the other boys and girls
were planning surprises and gifts of price for Teacher, his hands were
as empty as his heart was full. Appeal to his mother met with denial
prompt and energetic.</p>

<p>“For what you go und make, over Christmas, presents?”</p>

<p>“All the other fellows buys her presents, und I’m loving mit her
too; it’s polite I gives her presents the while I’m got such a kind
feeling over her,” said Morris stoutly.</p>

<p>“Well, we ain’t got no money for buy nothings,” said Mrs.
Mogilewsky sadly. “No money, und your papa, he has all times a
scare he shouldn’t to get no more.”</p>

<p>So Morris was helpless, his mother poor, and Teacher all unknowing.</p>

<p>And now the great day, the Friday before Christmas, came, and the
school was, for the first half-hour, quite mad. Room 18, generally
so placid and so peaceful, was a howling wilderness full of brightly
colored, quickly changing groups of children, all whispering, all
gurgling, and all hiding queer bundles.</p>

<p>Isidore Belchatosky was the first to lay tribute before Teacher. He
came forward with a sweet smile and a tall candlestick, and Teacher,
for a moment, could not be made to understand that all that length
of bluish-white china was really hers “for keeps.”</p>

<p>“It’s to-morrow holiday,” Isidore assured her; “and we gives you
presents, the while we have a kind feeling. Candlesticks could to cost
twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! three for ten,” said a voice in the background; but
Teacher hastened to respond to Isidore’s test of her credulity.</p>

<p>“Indeed, they could. This candlestick could have cost fifty cents,
and it’s just what I want. It is very good of you to bring me a
present.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome,” said Isidore, retiring.</p>

<p>And then, the ice being broken, the First-Reader Class in a body
rose to cast its gifts on Teacher’s desk, and its arms around Teacher’s
neck.</p>

<p>Nathan Horowitz presented a small cup and saucer; Isidore Applebaum
bestowed a large calendar for the year before last; Sadie Gonorowsky
brought a basket containing a bottle of perfume, a thimble, and
a bright silk handkerchief; Sarah Schrodsky offered a pen-wiper and
a yellow celluloid collarbutton, and Eva Kidansky gave an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
nasal douche, under the pleasing delusion that it was an atomizer.</p>

<p>Jacob Spitsky pressed forward with a tortoise-shell comb of terrifying
aspect and hungry teeth, and an air showing forth a determination
to adjust it in its destined place. Teacher meekly bowed her head;
Jacob forced his offering into her long-suffering hair, and then retired
with the information “Costs fifteen cents, Teacher.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rush of presentation went steadily on. Cups and
saucers came in wild profusion. The desk was covered with them.
The soap, too, became urgently perceptible. It was of all sizes, shapes
and colors, but of uniform and dreadful power of perfume. Teacher’s
eyes filled with tears—of gratitude—as each new piece or box was
pressed against her nose, and Teacher’s mind was full of wonder as
to what she could ever do with it all. Bottles of perfume vied with
one another and with the all-pervading soap, until the air was heavy
and breathing grew laborious. But pride swelled the hearts of the
assembled multitude. No other Teacher had so many helps to the
toilet. None other was so beloved.</p>

<p>When the wastepaper basket had been twice filled with wrappings
and twice emptied; when order was emerging out of chaos; when
the Christmas-tree had been disclosed and its treasures distributed, a
timid hand was laid on Teacher’s knee and a plaintive voice whispered,
“Say, Teacher, I got something for you”; and Teacher turned quickly
to see Morris, her dearest boy charge.</p>

<p>“Now, Morris dear,” said Teacher, “you shouldn’t have troubled to
get me a present; you know you and I are such good friends that—”</p>

<p>“Teacher, yiss, ma’am,” Morris interrupted, in a bewitching and rising
inflection of his soft and plaintive voice. “I know you got a kind
feeling by me, and I couldn’t to tell even how I got a kind feeling by
you. Only it’s about that kind feeling I should give you a present.
I didn’t”—with a glance at the crowded desk—“I didn’t to have no
soap nor no perfumery, and my mamma she couldn’t to buy none by
the store; but, Teacher, I’m got something awful nice for you by
present.”</p>

<p>“And what is it, deary?” asked the already rich and gifted young
person. “What is my new present?”</p>

<p>“Teacher, it’s like this: I don’t know; I ain’t so big like I could
to know”—and, truly, God pity him! he was passing small—“it ain’t
for boys—it’s for ladies. Over yesterday on the night comes my papa
to my house, und he gives my mamma the present. Sooner she looks
on it, sooner she has a awful glad; in her eyes stands tears, und she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
says, like that—out of Jewish—‘Thanks,’ un’ she kisses my papa a kiss.
Und my papa, how he is polite! He says—out of Jewish, too—‘you’re
welcome, all right,’ un’ he kisses my mamma a kiss. So my mamma,
she sets und looks on the present, und all the time she looks she has
a glad over it. Und I didn’t to have no soap, so you could to have
the present.”</p>

<p>“But did your mother say I might?”</p>

<p>“Teacher, no, ma’am; she didn’t say like that, und she didn’t to say
not like that. She didn’t to know. But it’s for ladies, un’ I didn’t
to have no soap. You could to look on it. It ain’t for boys.”</p>

<p>And here Morris opened a hot little hand and disclosed a tightly
folded pinkish paper. As Teacher read it he watched her with eager,
furtive eyes, dry and bright, until hers grew suddenly moist, when his
promptly followed suit. As she looked down at him, he made his
moan once more:</p>

<p>“It’s for ladies, and I didn’t to have no soap.”</p>

<p>“But, Morris dear,” cried Teacher, unsteadily, laughing a little, and
yet not far from tears, “this is ever so much nicer than soap—a thousand
times better than perfume; and you’re quite right, it is for ladies,
and I never had one in all my life before. I am so very thankful.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, all right. That’s how my papa says; it’s polite.
Und my mamma,” he said insinuatingly—“she kisses my papa
a kiss.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Teacher.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Morris, “you ain’t never kissed me a kiss, und I seen
how you kissed Eva Gonorowsky. I’m loving mit you too. Why
don’t you never kiss me a kiss?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Teacher mischievously, “perhaps it ain’t for
boys.”</p>

<p>“Teacher, yiss, ma’am; it’s for boys,” he cried, as he felt her arms
about him, and saw that in her eyes, too, “stands tears.”</p>

<p>Late that night Teacher sat in her pretty room and reviewed her
treasures. She saw that they were very numerous, very touching, very
whimsical, and very precious. But above all the rest she cherished a
frayed and pinkish paper, rather crumpled and a little soiled. For it
held the love of a man and a woman and a little child, and the magic
of a home, for Morris Mogilewsky’s Christmas present for ladies was
the receipt for a month’s rent for a room on the top floor of a Monroe
Street tenement.—From “Little Citizens,” copyrighted by <i>Doubleday,

<h5>THE CAMP-MEETING AT BLUFF SPRINGS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Justin Truitt Bishop</span></p>

<p>Bascom Barnard paused on the kitchen steps, and looked in at the
door with suspicion and irritation in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Bakin’ chickens, air ye?” he asked. “Now I’d like to know what
ye’re wastin’ chickens fur at this rate? An’ pies an’ lightbread an’
puddin’, well the land, Ma’ Jane, did ye think we was millionaires?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but ye’d change your mind about goin’ over to the
camp-meetin’ an’ it would help along to have most of the cookin’ for
Sunday done at home,” she said humbly.</p>

<p>“It does seem to me, Ma’ Jane, that it takes more talkin’ to convince
you of anything, than any other seventeen women I ever have saw.
I’ve tol’ you every day for the last week that we warn’t goin’ to that
dratted camp-meetin’—that we couldn’t both leave, and I was bound
to go over to the corners and see Bink Denny about that land—that
a woman’s business was at home, stid of gallivantin’ ’round the country
’tendin’ camp-meetin’s; cain’t you ever learn anything, Ma’ Jane?”</p>

<p>Ma’ Jane shut the oven door and stood up; she wiped the perspiration
from her face with a checked apron.</p>

<p>“I’ve been hopin’ for years that they’d have a camp-meetin’ near
enough for me to go. I’ve not ’tended since I was a girl. Mother
always had a tent an’ you was glad enough to come to camp-meetin’
then, Bascom, an’ this one’s not more’n six miles away—an’ I want
to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know good an’ well you cain’t. Somebody’s got to stay
on this place to take keer o’ things—an’ since it cain’t be me, it’s got
to be you.”</p>

<p>“Mary Hopkins tol’ me she’d save one end of her tent for me; it’s
built o’ boards—two rooms and a hall between—an’ there’s a big shed
at the back for a dining-room, an’ I wanted to go worse’n I ever
wanted to go anywheres, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Fur’s that’s concerned, I reckon I wanted to go, but you don’t see
me throwin’ our livin’ away so’s I could gallop off to every camp-meetin’
that comes along, do ye?</p>

<p>“I won’t be back for three days,” he stated, as he went away. In
deep silence Ma’ Jane sat down and looked at the kitchen table. It
was heaped with the good things she had prepared for the great
Sunday dinner at the camp-ground, where it was the joy of every
tenter to keep open house and entertain all who would come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>True, Bascom had said all along that they could not go, yet she
had gone on cooking and planning. She had even packed most of the
things which she would need for housekeeping in the other end of
Mary Hopkins’s tent.</p>

<p>Ma’ Jane went out to the barn and looked at the cows, which were
ready to eat again, having been fed fully an hour before.</p>

<p>“Drat ye,” said she vindictively. Coming from Ma’ Jane, this might
have been considered mild profanity.</p>

<p>Her heart stood still for a moment, then she wept remorsefully on
the outstretched nose of the nearest cow. “It’s about time I was goin’
to camp-meetin’,” she said. “If I ain’t gettin’ to be a heathen, I dunno
who is.”</p>

<p>As she slowly walked out of the barn, the two cows followed her,
and it was at the barn-door that an inspiration came to Ma’ Jane
Barnard.</p>

<p>Her face paled a moment, and then flushed crimson. She put her
hand to her throat—“them cows lead like dogs,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Bascom Barnard’s work at the corners was over in less time than
he had contemplated. In fact, he met Bink Denny coming out of the
“First and Last Chance” in such a state of intoxication that Bascom
was glad to tear himself away and set forth on the homeward road.</p>

<p>He went slowly and sorrowfully, because if he went home, Ma’
Jane would insist on going to camp-meeting and he would be left
alone over Sunday. The few times when he had been left to look
after the house had been brief but memorable. Of course, it was no
trouble for Ma’ Jane to run the place. She was already reconciled
to the staying at home now, anyway, and did not expect to go to the
camp-meeting.</p>

<p>Bascom was silent on his way home—only two or three miles off
the road—and he really felt that it would do him good to see what
a camp-meeting was like once more. He felt that he might finish up
the day there at any rate, and then go home and give Ma’ Jane a
chance; or he might stay over Sunday at the camp-grounds, and then
go back to the corners, find Bink Denny sober, and transact his business
according to the first arrangement.</p>

<p>Bascom Barnard turned into the road that led to Bluff Springs. The
sound of hammering and sawing, and the merry clatter of tongues
proclaimed the camp-ground before he was in sight of it. He rode into
the busy little city where board and canvas tents were going up like
magic. Brother Wilkins, the minister, called cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Hello, Brother Barnard, where’s Sister Barnard, ain’t she coming?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“She kinder thot she wouldn’t come. Ma’ Jane sets a lot o’ store
by the cows and things, ye see—so she reckoned she’d stay.”</p>

<p>He rode hurriedly down the line of tents, where a fire of questions
met him at every turn.</p>

<p>“I jes couldn’t get Ma’ Jane to come,” he explained to Miss Mirandy
Barr. “It don’t suit her to come away and leave things at six’s and
seven’s, as she says, so she jes stays by the stuff, Ma’ Jane does.”</p>

<p>Bascom Barnard began helping people to get their tents in order.</p>

<p>Before noon, he told his friends that Ma’ Jane didn’t know what
she was missing, and immediately after dinner—chicken-pie and fixin’s—if
they thought it would do any good, he would go after Ma’ Jane yet
and make her come, whether or no.</p>

<p>Just before the afternoon service, he said it was an awful mistake
to have a body’s mind on worldly things.</p>

<p>In the still hours of the night Bascom reasoned it out. He had not
treated himself to a holiday this many a year, and now he felt he was
entitled to one. Ma’ Jane could take hers some other time; besides,
a woman’s work was never wearin’ like a man’s—keepin’ house was
like play compared with what he had been called upon to do. He
turned over on the fragrant hay mattress, with which Sister Clark
had provided him, and went comfortably to sleep.</p>

<p>The clear notes of a horn roused everybody for the sunrise prayer-meeting,
and Bascom hurried arbor-wards with the others.</p>

<p>“Will Brother Barnard please lead us in prayer?” said the minister,
when the first hymn had been sung. Brother Barnard found himself
on his knees stumbling over a few familiar phrases; as he went on he
gained confidence and his voice became assured. He remarked upon
the fact that our days are few and evil.</p>

<p>After a few similar remarks, he got in full swing—time was no
object—scraps of forgotten phrases from prayers heard in his youth
tumbled forth in picturesque confusion. The hour for prayer-meeting
to close had come when he began to pray for the heathen, and this
took time of itself. When he had worked around to the sinful and
depraved of our own land, everybody would have been impatient, but
for the fact that something had happened—something that Bascom
could not see, as his eyes were shut. There were some who kept their
eyes open when they prayed; these nudged each other excitedly.</p>

<p>“An’ now, Lord,” pleaded Brother Bascom Barnard, pounding the
bench in front of him with a clenched fist, “be with all that’s near
and dear to them that’s gathered here to worship Thee. Be with them
that’s stayed by the stuff—an’ if they’ve stayed away from this blessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
place because they’re cold or hard-hearted—as we fear some of ’em
has—O Lord, melt their hearts of stone an’ make ’em see that they’re
hangin’ over eternal punishment prepared for the devil and his angels.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said a clear voice, undeniably feminine, which seemed in
some unaccountable way to come from the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Bascom was kneeling in the sawdust near the altar, and facing the
congregation. The voice came from behind him. Involuntarily he
looked back over his shoulder. At the same moment a faint giggle
arose somewhere down among the benches where the congregation
was kneeling.</p>

<p>An old horse and wagon had drawn up close at the edge of the
arbor, and Ma’ Jane, her best bonnet tied under her chin, held the
reins. The wagon was piled high with a medley of things pertaining
to housekeeping. Three coops of excited chickens topped the pile,
the anxious mewing of a cat came from a basket behind the seat,
and tied to the back of the wagon were two cows, both intimating
that something to eat would be quite acceptable. Under the wagon
sat the black puppy, its astonished head to one side as it viewed its
master under these unaccustomed circumstances.</p>

<p>Every one had arisen and was looking with might and main. The
minister hastily pronounced the benediction.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to move in on Sunday,” explained Ma’ Jane, “but it’s
took me all night to get ready an’ to come. My husband couldn’t help
me because he was over to the corners, makin’ a trade with Bink
Denny. I warn’t goin’ to stay at home tendin’ the cows and things
while camp-meetin’ was goin’ on only six miles away, so I brung ’em
all along. ’Long as Bascom’s not here, if some of you would help
me unload at Mary Hopkins’s tent, I’d be thankful, an’ you’ll take
dinner with me to-day, Brother Wilkins—an’ as many more as can
crowd in.”</p>

<p>That dinner in the other end of Mary Hopkins’s tent, was a thing
long to be remembered. Bascom crept meekly in after awhile and
offered himself at least as a guest. But Ma’ Jane remarked dryly,
“My husband not bein’ here, I reckon I can’t take you in—I ain’t
makin’ no new acquaintances.” He went away and ate with Miss
Mirandy Barr, who had corn-beef and cold potatoes for dinner. Somehow
everything was different.</p>

<p>The minister’s sermon on hypocrisy that afternoon was something
terrible to hear, and sounded personal to the last degree. Another
meal at Miss Mirandy Barr’s with a night on a pallet at Sister Clark’s
prepared Bascom to enter upon another day with a chastened spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
but there was no relenting on the part of Ma’ Jane. Between sermons
he heard goodly sounds of cooking at her tent and, wandering near,
smelled such odors as tore his very being asunder. But he was an
outcast there, and might not hope to enter. He listened to the sermons
in gloomy silence; his voice was not raised in the hymns.</p>

<p>But when the long day had worn itself out, and the night service
was going on, he sat looking around on the scene from which it seemed
that he was all at once shut out.</p>

<p>Over there in the brightest light he saw Ma’ Jane, her face lifted,
her hands clasped in her lap. He saw how gray she was getting and
how shabby. That best bonnet of hers had been bought fifteen years
before, and she had washed the ribbon and retrimmed it many times.
While he looked he saw the tears on her face too. The hands she
raised to wipe them were rough and hard; how she must have worked!</p>

<p>The minister had turned towards him and looked into his eyes. What
he saw there decided him—“Will Brother Bascom Barnard lead us in
prayer?” And Brother Bascom Barnard fell on his knees, shaken
with sobs.</p>

<p>“The Lord forgive us for bein’ miserable fools,” he cried, “an’ give
us a chance to try again an’ see if we can’t do better next time, Amen!”
It was a very complete prayer; after it was over Bascom found a hand
on his arm, and there was Ma’ Jane looking up at him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some chicken-pie saved up for you, Bascom,” she whispered.
And they went away toward the tent, arm in arm, walking where the
shadows of the trees lay thickest. “It looks like we’re goin’ to have
a great meetin’,” he said, stumbling. “I’m awful glad you got a chance
to come, Ma’ Jane.”</p>

<h5>THE CATACOMBS OF PALERMO</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">J. Ross Browne</span></p>

<p>Chief among the wonders of Palermo are the Catacombs of the
Capuchin Convent, near to Porta d’Ossuna. It is said to be a place
of great antiquity; many of the bodies have been preserved in it for
centuries, and still retain much of their original freshness. Entering
the ancient and ruinous court of the convent, distant about a mile
from the city, I was conducted by a ghostly-looking monk through
some dark passages to the subterranean apartments of the dead. It
was not my first visit to a place of this kind, but I must confess the
sight was rather startling. It was like a revel of the dead—a horrible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
grinning, ghastly exhibition of skeleton forms, sightless eyes, and
shining teeth, jaws distended, and bony hands outstretched; heads
without bodies, and bodies without heads—the young, the old, the
brave, the once beautiful and gay, all mingled in the ghastly throng.
I walked through long subterranean passages, lined with the dead
on both sides; with a stealthy and measured tread I stepped, for they
seemed to stare at the intrusion, and their skeleton fingers vibrated
as if yearning to grasp the living in their embrace. Long rows of upright
niches are cut into the walls on each side; in every niche a
skeleton form stands erect as in life, habited in a robe of black; the
face, hands, and feet naked, withered, and of an ashy hue; the grizzled
beards still hanging in tufts from the jaws, but matted and dry. To
each corpse is attached a label upon which is written the name and
the date of decease, and a cross or the image of the Saviour....</p>

<p>Who was the prince here? Who was the great man, or the proud
man, or the rich man? The musty, grinning, ghastly skeleton in the
corner seemed to chuckle at the thought, and say to himself, “Was it
you, there on the right, you ugly, noseless, sightless, disgusting thing?
Was it you that rode in your fine carriage, about a year ago, and
thought yourself so great when you ordered your coachman to drive
over the beggar? Don’t you see he is as handsome as you are now,
and as great a man; you can’t cut him down now, my fine fellow!
And you, there on the left. What a nice figure you are, with your
fleshless shanks and your worm-eaten lips! It was you that betrayed
youth and beauty and innocence, and brought yourself here at last
to keep company with such wretches as I am. Why, there is not a
living thing now, save the maggots, that wouldn’t turn away in disgust
from you. And you, sir, on the opposite side, how proud you
were the last time I saw you; an officer of state, a great man in power,
who could crush all below you, and make the happy wife a widowed
mourner, and bring her little babes to starvation; it was you who had
innocent men seized and thrown into prison. What can you do now?
The meanest wretch that mocks you in this vault of death is as good
as you, as strong, as great, as tall, as broad, as pretty a piece of mortality,
and a great deal nearer to heaven. Oh, you are a nice set of
fellows, all mixing together without ceremony! Where are your rules
of etiquette now; your fashionable ranks, and your plebeian ranks;
your thousands of admiring friends, your throngs of jeweled visitors?
Why, the lowliest of us has as many visitors here, and as many honest
tears shed as you. Ha! Ha! This is a jolly place, after all; we are
all a jolly set of republicans, and old Death is our President.”—From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>

<h5>GETTING READY FOR THE TRAIN</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Robert J. Burdette</span></p>

<p>When they reached the station, Mr. and Mrs. Man gazed in unspeakable
disappointment at the receding train which was just pulling
away from the station at the rate of about a thousand miles a minute.
Their first impulse was to run after it, but as the train was out of
sight and whistling for the next station before they could act upon
this impulse, they remained in the auto and disconsolately turned
homeward.</p>

<p>“It all comes of having to wait for a woman to get ready!”</p>

<p>“I was ready before you were!”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, just listen to that! And I sat out in the car ten
minutes yelling for you to come along until the whole neighborhood
heard me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and every time I started down the stairs you sent me back
after something you had forgotten.”</p>

<p>Mr. Man groaned. “This is too much to bear when everybody knows
that if I were going to Europe I would just rush in the house, put on
a clean shirt, grab a grip and fly, while you would want at least six
months to get ready in and then dawdle around the whole day of
starting until every train had left town.”</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of the matter was that the Mans put off their visit
to San Diego until the next week, when it was agreed that each one
should get himself or herself ready, get down to the train and go.
And the one who failed to get ready should be left.</p>

<p>The day of the match came around in due time. The train was to
leave at ten-thirty and Mr. Man, after attending to business, came home
at nine forty-five.</p>

<p>“Now, then, only three-quarters of an hour until train time. Fly
around. A fair field and no favors, you know.”</p>

<p>And away they flew. Mr. Man bulged into this room, and rushed
through that, and into one closet after another, with inconceivable
chuckling under his breath all the time to think how cheap Mrs. Man
would feel when he started off alone. He stopped on the way upstairs
to pull off his heavy boots to save time. For the same reason
he pulled off his coat as he ran through the dining-room and hung it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
on the corner of the silver closet. Then he jerked off his vest as he
ran through the hall and tossed it on a hook on the hatrack, and by
the time he reached his own room he was ready to plunge into clean
clothes. He pulled out a dresser drawer and began to paw among
the things like a Scotch terrier after a rat. “Elinor, where are my
shirts?”</p>

<p>“In your dresser drawer.”</p>

<p>“Well, but they ain’t. I’ve pulled out every last thing and there isn’t
a thing I’ve ever seen before.”</p>

<p>(Laughing.) “These things scattered around on the floor are all
mine; perhaps you haven’t been looking in your own drawer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you couldn’t put my things out for me, when you
had nothing to do all morning.”</p>

<p>“Because—because, nobody put mine out. A fair field and no favors,
my dear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Man plunged into his shirt. “Gad, no buttons on the neck!”</p>

<p>“Because you have it on wrong side out.”</p>

<p>When his head came through the clock struck ten. “Where’s my
shirt studs?”</p>

<p>“In the shirt you just pulled off.” Mrs. Man put on her gloves while
Mr. Man hunted up and down the room for his cuff buttons.</p>

<p>“Elinor, I believe you must know where those buttons are.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see them. Didn’t you leave them on the window-sill in the
living-room last night?”</p>

<p>Mr. Man remembered, and down the stairs he flew. He stepped on
one of his boots and was immediately landed at the foot of the stairs
with neatness and dispatch, attended in the transmission with more
bumps than he could count.</p>

<p>“Are you nearly ready, dear?”</p>

<p>The unhappy man groaned. “Can’t you throw me down my other
boot?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Man pitifully kicked it down to him.</p>

<p>“My valise?”</p>

<p>“In your dressing-room.”</p>

<p>“Packed?”</p>

<p>“I do not know; unless you packed it yourself probably not. I had
hardly time to pack my own.” She was passing out of the gate when
the door opened and he shouted: “Where in the name of goodness
did you put my vest? It has all my money in it.”</p>

<p>“You threw it on the hatrack; good-by, dear.”</p>

<p>Before she reached the corner of the street she was hailed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Elinor! Elinor Man! Did you wear off my coat?”</p>

<p>She paused after signaling the street car to stop, and cried: “You
threw it on the silver-closet,” and the street car engulfed her graceful
form and she was seen no more.</p>

<p>But the neighbors say that they heard Mr. Man charging up and
down the house, rushing out to the front door every now and then
and shrieking up the deserted street after the unconscious Mrs. Man
to know where his hat was and where did she put the valise key, and
that there wasn’t a linen collar in the house.</p>

<p>And when he went away at last he left the front door, the kitchen
door, and side door, all the down-stairs windows and front gate wide
open, and the loungers around the station were somewhat amused,
just as the train was pulling out of sight down in the yards, to see a
flushed, perspiring man with his hat on sideways, his vest unbuttoned,
necktie flying, and his grip flapping open and shut like a demented
shutter on a March night, and a doorkey in his hand, dash wildly
across the platform and halt in the middle of the track, glaring in
dejected, impatient, wrathful mortification at the departing train, and
shaking his fist at the pretty woman who was throwing kisses at him
from the rear platform of the last car.</p>

<p>“A fair field and no favors, my dear!”</p>

<h5>A STARTLING ADVENTURE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. Ross Browne</span></p>

<p>I descended several of these shafts rather to oblige my friend, the
Judge, than to satisfy any curiosity I had on the subject myself.
This thing of being dropped down two hundred feet into the bowels
of the earth in wooden buckets, and hoisted out by blind horses attached
to “whims,” may be very amusing to read about, but I have
enjoyed pleasanter modes of locomotion. There was one shaft in
particular that left an indelible impression upon my mind—so much
so, indeed, that I am astonished every hair in my head is not quite
gray. It was in the San Antonia, a mine in which the Judge held
an interest in connection with a worthy Norwegian by the name of
Jansen. As I had traveled in Norway, Jansen was enthusiastic in his
devotion to my enjoyment—declared he would go down with me himself
and show me everything worth seeing—even to the lower level
just opened. While I was attempting to frame an excuse the honest
Norwegian had lighted a couple of candles, given directions to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of the “boys” to look out for the old blind horse attached to the
“whim” and now stood ready at the mouth of the shaft to guide
me into the subterranean regions.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jansen,” said I, looking with horror at the rickety wooden
bucket and the flimsy little rope that was to hold us suspended between
the surface of the earth and eternity, “is that rope strong?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s strong enough to hold us,” replied Jansen; “it
carries a ton of ore. We don’t weigh a ton, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But the bucket looks fearfully battered. And who can vouch that
the old horse won’t run away and let us down by the run?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, he’s used to it. That horse never runs. You see, he’s
fast asleep now. He sleeps all along on the down turn. It’s the up
turn that gets him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jansen,” said I, “all that may be true; but suppose the bucket
should catch and drop us out?”</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes it catches; but nobody’s been hurt bad yet; one
man fell fifteen feet perpendicular. He lit on the top of his head.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he killed?”</p>

<p>“No; he was only stunned a little. There was a buzzing about
among his brains for a few days after; he’s at work down below now,
as well as ever.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jansen, upon the whole I think I’d rather go down by the
ladder, if it’s all the same to you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, suit yourself; only the ladder’s sort o’ broke in
spots, and you’ll find it a tolerably hard climb down; how-so-ever,
I’ll go ahead and sing out when I come to bad places.”</p>

<p>With this the Norwegian disappeared. I looked down after him.
The shaft was about four feet square; rough, black and dismal, with
a small, flickering light, apparently a thousand feet below, making the
darkness visible. It was almost perpendicular; the ladders stood
against the near side, perched on ledges or hanging together by means
of chafed and ragged-looking ropes. I regretted that I had not taken
Jansen’s advice and committed myself to the bucket; but it was now
too late. With a hurried glance at the bright world around me, a
thought of home and unhappy conditions of widows and orphans, as
a general thing, I seized the rungs of the ladder and took the irrevocable
dive. Down I crept, rung after rung, ladder after ladder,
in the black darkness, with the solid walls of rock pressing the air
close around me. Sometimes I heard the incoherent muttering of
voices below, but could make nothing of them. Perhaps Jansen was
warning me of breaks in the ladder; perhaps his voice was split up by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the rocks and sounded like many voices; or it might be there were
gnomes whisking about in the dark depths below. Down and still
down I crept, slower and slower, for I was getting tired, and I fancied
there might be poisonous gases in the air. When I had reached the
depth of a thousand feet, as it seemed, but about a hundred and forty
as it was in reality, the thought occurred to me that I was beginning
to get alarmed. In truth I was shaking like a man with the ague.
Suppose I should become nervous and lose my hold on the ladder?
The very idea was enough to make me shaky. There was an indefinite
extent of shaft underneath, black, narrow and scraggy, with a solid
base of rock at the bottom. I did not wonder that it caused a buzzing
of the brain to fall fifteen feet and light on top of the head. My
brain was buzzing already, and I had not fallen yet. But the prospect
to that effect was getting better and better every moment, for I
was now quite out of breath, and had to stop and cling around the
ladder to avoid falling. The longer I stood this way the more certain
it became that I should lose my balance and topple over. With a desperate
effort I proceeded, step after step, clinging desperately to the
frail wood-work as the drowning man clings to a straw, gasping for
breath, the cold sweat streaming down my face, and my jaws chattering
audibly. The breaks in the ladder were getting fearfully common.
Sometimes I found two rungs gone, sometimes six or seven, and then
I had to slide down by the sides till my feet found a resting-place on
another rung or some casual ledge of rock. To Jansen, or the miners
who worked down in the shaft every day, all of this, of course, was
mere pastime. They knew every break and resting-place; and besides,
familiarity with any particular kind of danger blunts the sense
of it. I am confident that I could make the same trip now without
experiencing any unpleasant sensation. By good fortune I at length
reached the bottom of the shaft, where I found my Norwegian friend
and some three or four workmen quietly awaiting my arrival. A
bucket of ore, containing some five or six hundred pounds, was ready
to be hoisted up. It was very nice-looking ore, and very rich ore,
as Jansen assured me; but what did I care about ore till I got the
breath back again into my body?</p>

<p>“Stand from under, sir,” said Jansen, dodging into a hole in the
rocks; “a chunk of ore might fall out, or the bucket might give way.”</p>

<p>Stand from under? Where in the name of sense was a man to
stand in such a hole as this, not more than six or eight feet square
at the base, with a few dark chasms in the neighborhood through
which it was quite possible to be precipitated into the infernal regions?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
However, I stood as close to the wall as was possible without backing
clean into it. The bucket of ore having gone up out of sight, I was
now introduced to the ledge upon which the men were at work. It
was about four feet thick, clearly defined, and apparently rich in the
precious metals. In some specimens which I took out myself gold
was visible to the naked eye. The indications of silver were also
well marked. This was at a depth of a hundred and seventy-five feet.
At the bottom of this shaft there was a loose flooring of rafters and
planks.</p>

<p>“If you like,” said Jansen, “we’ll go down here and take a look
at the lower drift. They’ve just struck the ledge about forty feet
below.”</p>

<p>“Are the ladders as good as those above, Mr. Jansen?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; they’re all good; some of the lower ones may be
busted a little with the blastin’; but there’s two men down there.
Guess they got down somehow.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Mr. Jansen, I’m not curious about the lower
drift. You can show me some specimens of the ore, and that will
be quite satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but I’d like you to see the vein where the drift strikes it.
It’s really beautiful.”</p>

<p>A beautiful sight down in this region was worth looking at, so
I succumbed. Jansen lifted up the planks, told the men to cover us
well up as soon as we had disappeared, in order to keep the ore from
the upper shaft from tumbling on our heads, and then, diving down,
politely requested me to follow. I had barely descended a few steps
when the massive rafters and planks were thrown across overhead
and thus all exit to the outer world was cut off. There was an oppressive
sensation in being so completely isolated from the outside
world—barred out, as it were, from the surface of the earth. Yet
how many there are who spend half their lives in such a place for a
pittance of wages which they squander in dissipation! Surely it is
worth four dollars a day to work in these dismal holes.</p>

<p>Bracing my nerves with such thoughts as these, I scrambled down
the rickety ladders till the last rung seemed to have disappeared. I
probed about with a spare leg for a landing place, but could touch
neither top, bottom nor sides. The ladder was apparently suspended
in space like Mohammed’s coffin.</p>

<p>“Come on, sir,” cried the voice of Jansen far down below. “They’re
going to blast.”</p>

<p>Pleasant, if not picturesque, to be hanging by two arms and one leg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
to a ladder, squirming about in search of a foothold, while somebody
below was setting fire to a fuse with the design, no doubt, of blowing
up the entire premises!</p>

<p>“Mr. Jansen,” said I, in a voice of unnatural calmness, while the
big drops of agony stood on my brow, “there’s no difficulty in saying
‘Come on, sir!’ but to do it without an inch more of ladder or anything
else that I can see, requires both time and reflection. How far
do you expect me to drop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you let go, sir. Just hang on to that rope at the bottom
of the ladder, and let yourself down.”</p>

<p>I hung on as directed and let myself down. It was plain sailing
enough to one who knew the chart. The ladder, it seemed, had been
broken by a blast of rocks; and now there was to be another blast.
We retired into a convenient hole about ten or a dozen paces from
the deposit of Hazard’s powder. The blast went off with a dead
reverberation, causing a concussion in the air that affected one like
a shock of galvanism; and then there was a diabolical smell of brimstone.
Jansen was charmed at the result. A mass of the ledge was
burst clean open. He grasped up the blackened fragments of quartz,
licked them with his tongue, held them up to the candle, and constantly
exclaimed: “There, sir, there! Isn’t it beautiful? Did you
ever see anything like it?—pure gold, almost—here it is!—don’t you
see it?”</p>

<p>I suppose I saw it; at all events I put some specimens in my pocket,
and saw them afterward out in the pure sunlight, where the smoke
was not so dense; and it is due to the great cause of truth to say that
gold was there in glittering specks, as if shaken over it from a pepper-box.</p>

<p>Having concluded my examination of the mine, I took the bucket
as a medium of exit, being fully satisfied with the ladders. About
half-way up the shaft the iron swing or handle to which the rope was
attached caught in one of the ladders. The rope stretched. I felt it
harden and grow thin in my hands. The bucket began to tip over.
It was pitch dark all around. Jansen was far below, coming up the
ladder. Something seemed to be creaking, cracking, or giving way.
I felt the rough, heavy sides of the bucket press against my legs. A
terrible apprehension seized me that the gear was tangled and would
presently snap. In the pitchy darkness and the confusion of the
moment I could not conjecture what was the matter. I darted out
my hands, seized the ladder and, jerking myself high out of the bucket,
clambered up with the agility of an acrobat. Relieved of my weight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
the iron catch came loose, and up came the bucket banging and thundering
after me with a velocity that was perfectly frightful. Never was
there such a subterranean chase, I verily believe, since the beginning
of the world. To stop a single moment would be certain destruction,
for the bucket was large, heavy and massively bound with iron, and
the space in the shaft was not sufficient to admit of its passing without
crushing me flat against the ladder.</p>

<p>But such a chase could not last long. I felt my strength give way
at every lift. The distance was too great to admit the hope of escape
by climbing. My only chance was to seize the rope above the bucket
and hang on to it. This I did. It was a lucky thought—one of those
thoughts that sometimes flash upon the mind like inspiration in a
moment of peril. A few more revolutions of the “whim” brought
me so near the surface that I could see the bucket only a few yards
below my feet. The noise of the rope over the block above reminded
me that I had better slip down a little to save my hands, which I did
in good style, and was presently landed on the upper crust of the
earth, all safe and sound, though somewhat dazzled by the light and
rattled by my subterranean experiences.—From “Adventures in the

<h5>HOW CY HOPKINS GOT A SEAT</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Marshall P. Wilder</span></p>

<p>In one of the country stores where they sell everything from a silk
dress and a tub of butter to a hot drink and a cold meal, a lot of
farmers were sitting around the stove one cold day, when in came
Farmer Evans, who was greeted with:</p>

<p>“How d’do, Ezry?”</p>

<p>“How d’do boys?” After awhile he continued: “Wa-all, I’ve killed
my hog.”</p>

<p>“That so? How much did he weigh?”</p>

<p>Farmer Evans stroked his chin whiskers meditatively and replied:
“Wa-all, guess.”</p>

<p>“’Bout three hundred,” said one farmer.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Two seventy-five,” ventured another.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I guess about three twenty-five,” said a third.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>Then all together demanded: “Well, how much did he weigh?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. Hain’t weighed him yet.”</p>

<p>Other men kept dropping in and hugging the stove, for the day was
cold and snowy outside. In came Cy Hopkins, wrapped in a big overcoat,
yet almost frozen to death; but there wasn’t room enough around
that stove to warm his little finger.</p>

<p>But he didn’t get mad about it; he just said to Bill Stebbins who
kept the stove: “Bill, got any raw oysters?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Cy.”</p>

<p>“Well, just open a dozen and feed ’em to my hoss.”</p>

<p>Well, Stebbins never was scared by an order from a man whose
credit was good as Cy’s was, so he opened the oysters and took them
out, an’ the whole crowd followed to see a horse eat oysters. Then
Cy picked out the best seat near the stove and dropped into it as if
he had come to stay, as he had.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the crowd came back, and the storekeeper said: “Why,
Cy, your hoss won’t eat them oysters.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he? Well, then, bring ’em here an’ I’ll eat ’em myself.”—From

<h5>SETTLING UNDER DIFFICULTIES</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Robert J. Burdette</span></p>

<p>Strangers visiting the beautiful city of Burlington have not failed to
notice that one of the handsomest young men they meet is very bald,
and they fall into the usual error of attributing this premature baldness
to dissipation. But such is not the case. This young man, one
of the most exemplary Bible-class scholars in the city, went to a
Baptist sociable out on West Hill one night about two years ago.
He escorted three charming girls, with angelic countenances and
human appetites, out to the refreshment table, let them eat all they
wanted, and then found he had left his pocketbook at home, and a
deaf man that he had never seen before at the cashier’s desk. The
young man, with his face aflame, bent down and said softly,</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to say I have no change with—”</p>

<p>“Hey?” shouted the cashier.</p>

<p>“I regret to say,” the young man repeated on a little louder key,
“that I have unfortunately come away without any change to—”</p>

<p>“Change two?” chirped the old man. “Oh, yes, I can change five
if you want it.”</p>

<p>“No,” the young man explained in a terrible, penetrating whisper, for
half-a-dozen people were crowding up behind him, impatient to pay
their bills and get away, “I don’t want any change, because—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t want no change?” the deaf man cried, gleefully. “’Bleeged
to ye, ’bleeged to ye. ’Tain’t often we get such generous donations.
Pass over your bill.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” the young man explained, “I have no funds—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenty of fun,” the deaf man replied, growing tired of the
conversation and noticing the long line of people waiting with money
in their hands, “but I haven’t got time to talk about it now. Settle
and move on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“But,” the young man gasped out, “I have no money—”</p>

<p>“Go Monday?” queried the deaf cashier. “I don’t care when you
go; you must pay and let these other people come up.”</p>

<p>“I have no money!” the mortified young man shouted, ready to sink
into the earth, while the people all around him, and especially the
three girls he had treated, were giggling and chuckling audibly.</p>

<p>“Owe money?” the cashier said, “of course you do; $2.75.”</p>

<p>“I can’t pay!” the youth screamed, and by turning his pocket inside
out and yelling his poverty to the heavens, he finally made the deaf
man understand. And then he had to shriek his full name three times,
while his ears fairly rang with the half-stifled laughter that was breaking
out all around him; and he had to scream out where he worked,
and roar when he would pay, and he couldn’t get the deaf man to
understand him until some of the church members came up to see
what the uproar was, and recognizing their young friend, made it all
right with the cashier. And the young man went out into the night
and clubbed himself, and shred his locks away until he was bald as
an egg.</p>

<h5>SODDING AS A FINE ART</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Robert J. Burdette</span></p>

<p>One day, early in the spring, Mr. Blosberg, who lives out on Ninth
Street, made up his mind that he would sod his front yard himself,
and when he had formed this public-spirited resolution, he proceeded
to put it into immediate execution. He cut his sod, in righteous and
independent and liberty-loving disregard of the ridiculous city ordinance
in relation thereto, from the patches of verdure that the cows
had permitted to obtain a temporary growth along the side of the
street, and proceeded to beautify his front yard therewith. Just as he
had laid the first sod, Mr. Thwackery, his next door neighbor, passed
by.</p>

<p>“Good land, Blosberg,” he shouted, “you’ll never be able to make
anything of such a sod as that. Why, it’s three inches too thick. That
sod will cake up and dry like a brick. You want to shave at least
two inches and a half off the bottom of it, so the roots of the grass
will grow into the ground and unite the sod with the earth. That
sod is thick enough for a corner stone.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Blosberg took the spade and shaved the sod down until it
was thin and about as pliable as a buckwheat cake, and Mr. Thwackery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
pronounced it all right and sure to grow, and passed on. Just as Mr.
Blosberg got it laid down the second time, old Mr. Templeton, who
lived on the next block, came along and leaned on the fence, intently
observing the sodder’s movements.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Blosberg,” he said at length, “I did think you had
better sense than that. Don’t you know a sod will never grow on
that hard ground? You must spade it all up first, and break the
dirt up fine and soft to the depth of at least four inches, or the grass
can never take root in it. Don’t waste your time and sod by putting
grass on top of such a baked brick-floor as that.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Blosberg laid aside the sod and took up the spade and
labored under Mr. Templeton’s directions until the ground was all
properly prepared for the sod, and then Mr. Templeton, telling him
that sod couldn’t die on that ground now if he tried to kill it, went
his way and Mr. Blosberg picked up that precious sod a third time,
and prepared to put it in its place. Before he had fairly poised it
over the spot, however, his hands were arrested by a terrific shout,
and looking up he saw Major Bladgers shaking his cane at him over
the fence.</p>

<p>“Blosberg, you insufferable donkey,” roared the Major, “don’t you
know that you’ll lose every blade of grass you can carry if you put
your sod on that dry ground? There you’ve gone and cut it so thin
that all the roots of the grass are cut and bleeding, and you must
soak that ground with water until it is a perfect pulp, so that the
roots will sink right into it, and draw nutrition from the moist earth.
Wet her down, Blosberg, if you want to see your labor result in anything.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Blosberg put the sod aside again, and went and pumped
water and carried it around in buckets until his back ached like a
soft corn, and when he had finally transformed the front yard into
a morass, the major was satisfied, and assuring Mr. Blosberg that his
sod would grow beautifully now, even if he laid it on upside down,
marched away, and Mr. Blosberg made a fourth effort to put the
first sod in its place. He got it down and was going back after
another, when old Mrs. Tweedlebug checked him in his wild career.</p>

<p>“Lawk, Mr. Blosberg, ye mustn’t go off an’ leave that sod lying that
way. You must take the spade and beat it down hard, till it is all flat
and level, and close to the ground everywhere. You must pound it
hard, or the weeds will all start up under it and crowd out the grass.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blosberg went back, and stooping over the sod hit it a resounding
thwack with his spade that shot great gouts and splotches of mud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
all over the parlor windows and half way to the top of the house, and
some of it came flying into his face and on his clothes, while a miscellaneous
shower made it dangerous even for his adviser, who, with a
feeble shriek of disapprobation, went hastily away, digging raw mud
out of her ears. Mr. Blosberg didn’t know how long to keep on
pounding, and he didn’t see Mrs. Tweedlebug go away, so he stood with
his spade poised in the air and his eyes shut tight, waiting for instructions.
And as he waited he was surprised to hear a new voice accost
him. It was the voice of Mr. Thistlepod, the old agriculturist, of
whom Mr. Blosberg bought his apples and butter.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Blosberg!” he shouted, in tones which indicated that he
either believed Mr. Blosberg to be stone deaf or two thousand miles
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Blosberg winked violently to get the soil out of his eyes, and
turned in the direction of the noise to say, “Good evening.”</p>

<p>“Soddin’, hey?” asked Mr. Thistlepod.</p>

<p>“Trying to, sir,” replied Mr. Blosberg, rather cautiously.</p>

<p>“’Spect it will grow, hey?”</p>

<p>Mr. Blosberg, having learned by very recent experience how liable
his plans were to be overthrown, was still non-committal, and replied
that “he hoped so.”</p>

<p>“Wal, if ye hope so, ye mustn’t go to poundin’ yer sod to pieces with
that spade. Ye don’t want to ram it down so dad binged tight and
hard there can’t no air git at the roots. Ye must shake that sod up a
little, so as to loosen it, and then jest press it down with yer foot
ontil it jest teches the ground nicely all around. Sod’s too thin,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Blosberg thrust his hands into the nasty mud under his
darling, much abused sod, and spread his fingers wide apart to keep it
from breaking to pieces as he raised it, and finally got it loosened up
and pressed down to Mr. Thistlepod’s satisfaction, who then told him
he didn’t believe he could make that sod grow anyway, and drove away.
Then Mr. Blosberg stepped back to look at that sod, feeling confident
that he had got through with it, when young Mr. Simpson came along.</p>

<p>“Hello, Blos, old boy; watchu doin’?”</p>

<p>Mr. Blosberg timorously answered that he was sodding a little. Then
Mr. Simpson pressed his lips very tightly together to repress a smile,
and let his cheeks swell and bulge out to the size of toy balloons with
suppressed merriment, and finally burst into a snort of derisive laughter
that made the windows rattle in the houses on the other side of the
street, and he went on, leaving Mr. Blosberg somewhat nettled and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
little discouraged. He stood, with his fingers spread wide apart, holding
his arms out like wings, and wondering whether he had better go
get another sod or go wash his hands, when a policeman came by, and
paused. “Soddin’?” he asked, sententiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a little,” replied Mr. Blosberg, respectfully.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get your sod?” inquired the representative of public
order.</p>

<p>Mr. Blosberg dolefully indicated the little bare parallelogram in the
scanty patch of verdure as his base of supplies.</p>

<p>“You’re the man I’ve been lookin’ for,” replied public order. “You
come along with me.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Blosberg went along, and the Police Judge fined him $11.95,
and when Mr. Blosberg got home he found that a cow had got into his
yard during his absence and stepped on that precious sod five times,
and put her foot clear through it every time, so that it looked like a
patch of moss rolled up in a wad, more than a sod. And then Mr.
Blosberg fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven, and registered
a vow that he would never plant another sod if this whole fertile
world turned into a Sahara for want of his aid.</p>

<h5>THE MISFORTUNES OF LITTLE IKE TEMPLIN</h5>

<p>In the midst of his supper one day it occurred to little Ike to resort
to the well for a drink of water. In time his mammy grew tired of
stopping her work whenever he grew thirsty to hand him down a
gourd from the pail which rested on the shelf beyond his reach.
Finally she said to him: “Boy, what ails you anyhow? G’long out
doors an’ try to be some use to somebody, stid of eatin’ up an’ drinkin’
up ev’yt’ing Mis’s got on her plantash’n.”</p>

<p>Little Ike, thus driven out, stood for a moment by the door and
looked at the well, which was a few rods distant. But he turned his
back upon it instantly, as if it were too painful to be thus reminded of
the source of his most recent disappointment, and began walking in
the opposite direction. When he had reached a spot on the line with
the end of the kitchen, he filed to the left and again to the left when
he had reached the rear side; and pursuing this line until he had gone
some distance beyond the well, turned again and came to the latter.
Stepping upon a hewn log which lay there to enable young drawers of
water to manage the bucket, he was pleased to find this utensil as it
was resting upon the ledge, half full of water. Conscious that the
time was short, he clambered up to the edge, got upon all fours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
grabbed with one hand the rim of the bucket, and with the other hand
the well-rope, and, first taking an anxious glance toward the kitchen
and a fond one toward the contents of the bucket, plunged in his head.
He had hardly taken a few sips when the call of his mother at its
accustomed pitch sounded from the kitchen.</p>

<p>And here I find myself under the painful necessity of recording a
most terrible scene. I suppose it will never be known precisely how
it happened, although no one, as well as I remember, ever suspected
little Ike of a deliberate intention to commit the awful crime of suicide.
It may have been that he had not known the use of his legs long
enough for the present extreme need, and that his knees may have
given a tilt to the bucket. At all events down they went together to
the bottom, a distance of thirty feet.</p>

<p>The mother, who had seen him at the moment when the descent
began, ran, half shrieking to the well, where she was joined by Mrs.
Templin a moment after.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mis’s, Mis’s, my po’ ophing chile have fell in de well and broke
his naik, and drown hese’f on top o’ that, an’ he my precious baby—an’
de las’ one I got!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Templin said: “I’m sorry for you, Judy. But maybe he has
been mercifully saved from drowning. Lean over and look down as
I turn the windlass.”</p>

<p>After a few turns, she knew by the feeling that the bucket had risen
to the surface of the water, which was some four feet deep.</p>

<p>“Now call him,” she said.</p>

<p>“Li’ll Iky! Li’ll Iky!” shouted Judy.</p>

<p>“Ma-a-a-a-me!” came a sharp, plaintive answer from the great deep.</p>

<p>“Is you down dar, precious?”</p>

<p>“Eth, e-e-eth, ’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, is you drownded?”</p>

<p>“No—no—no, ’m!”</p>

<p>“Well, well! Is you done gone all to pieces?”</p>

<p>“No—n-n-no, ’m!”</p>

<p>“Is anything de matter wid mammy’s precious boy baby?”</p>

<p>“I k-k-k-co-co-o-ld!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, where is you now?”</p>

<p>“In—in de—b-b-bucket!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Templin then directed the mother to urge the child to hold fast
to the rope while she herself would turn the windlass.</p>

<p>“Dar now, you heah dat? Mis’s say she wan’ my nice li’ll darky to
ketch tight hold to der rope—tight as a tick; an’ she say she gwine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
draw him up with her own blessed hands. Mis’s say she can’t ’ford to
lose likely li’ll fellow like my li’ll Ike, dat she can’t. Ye heah,
mammy’s precious suga’ lump?”</p>

<p>“E-e-e-e-th, ’m!”</p>

<p>The winding began, and the mother, being urged to encourage Ike
as much as possible during the ascent, did as well as she could by such
cheering remarks as these:</p>

<p>“Jes’ look at dat! Mis’s givin’ her li’ll niggah such a nice ride!
En Mis’s done tole mammy tah kill six chickens, an’ fry one o’m an’
brile one o’m an’ make pie out of de rest, an’ all for li’ll Iky’s dinner;
an’ she say she gwine make daddy barb’cue two pigs dis very evenin’,
and nobody ain’t to tech a mou’f’l on’m cep’n li’ll Iky if he’ll holt on
tah de well-rope. An’ she say, Mis’s do, she jes’ know her great big
li’ll Ike ain’t gwine to let dat rope loose an’ not get all dem goodies!”</p>

<p>It is possible that in so brief a time never was promised a greater
number of luxuries to a child born to loftiest estate. Chickens, ducks—indeed
the whole poultry yard was more than exhausted; every pig
on the plantation was done to a turn. During the ascent little Ike was
informed that eatables of every description would be at his disposal
forever. The time does not suffice to tell of other rewards promised
in the name of the munificent mistress, in the way of cakes, pies, syllabubs,
gold and silver and costly apparel. All this while, Mrs. Templin,
without uttering a word, turned the windlass, slowly, steadily.</p>

<p>When the bucket with its contents reached the top, and was safely
lodged upon the ledge, the mother seized her precious darling, his
teeth chattering the while with chill, and dragging him fiercely forth,
said in wrathful tones:</p>

<p>“A cold is yah? Well, ef I be bressed wid strength an’ ef dey is
peachy trees ’nough in de orchard, an’ de fence corners, I’ll wa’m yah.
You dat has sceert me intah fits, an’ made me tell all dem lies—dem
on Mis’s—dat I jes’ knows I never ken git fahgivin’ fo’ ’em.” And,
still holding him, she began striding toward the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Judy!” called her mistress sternly, “Judy, put down that child this
minute! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Instead of being thankful
that he wasn’t killed, here you stand and are so angry with him that
you look as though you wished to kill him yourself. Now take him
into your house and put some dry clothes on him; then send him to
me in the house, where I will have some coffee ready for him. And
mind you, Judy, if you lay your hands on that child in anger, that
won’t be the last of it. Do for goodness’ sake try to learn some reason
about your children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Judy led him away sullenly, and in spite of her mistress’s warning,
muttered direful threatenings, louder and louder, as she approached,
ending thus, as, having clothed him, she dispatched him to the big
house:</p>

<p>“Nevah yah min’, sah; wait till Sunday come, when Mis’s go tah
meetin’, an’ you’ll see! An’, boy, ef yah skeers me dat way ag’in, I’ll
put yah whar yah won’t wan’ no mo’ watah an’ no mo’ nothin’. The
idee! people all talkin’ ’bout my chile gittin’ drowned same as puppies
an’ kittens! Ought to be ’shamed o’ yourself! I is. I jes’ ’spises to
look at yah! G’long out my sight!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterwards, while little Ike was in the big house, luxuriating
in coffee, biscuit and fried chicken, she was singing in cheerful
voice one of her favorite hymns:</p>

<h5>THE RETURN OF THE HOE</h5>

<p>“Goliath Johnsing, why you so late? Supper been a sp’ilin’ on de
stove dis half hour,” and Aunt Lucy faced her liege lord with stern
dignity.</p>

<p>“Old Daddy Moses an’ me been a havin’ it out.”</p>

<p>“Havin’ what out? You ain’t been an’ had a fuss wid Mr. Benson,
’Liah Johnsing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. Ole Skincher. Here I have been a hoein’ hard in the
fiel’ all day, and he mean enough to dock my wages ten cents ’cause I
warn’t back at noon jest at de minnit. I warn’t late more’n half an
hour or three-quarters of an hour. But I give him piece of my mind.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose he don’ want to pay for work he don’ git.”</p>

<p>“Don’ git? Why, thar was Sam Stevens an’ Bill Jenkins; they talk
more’n half de time, an’ rested on they handles more’n t’other half,
an’ did he dock them any? Not he. He got spite ’gin me, I know
dat.”</p>

<p>“Whar’d you git dat new hoe?” queried Aunt Lucy, as ’Liah hung
that implement up in the woodshed.</p>

<p>“Neber you mind. Women always want to stick their nose into
ebbert’ing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“An’ what you done wid your ole hoe you took away this noon?
You didn’t trade that off for a new one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, ’f ye will know.”</p>

<p>“’Liah Johnsing,” blurted out Aunt Lucy, as a sudden suspicion
flamed in her eyes, “dat ain’t one of Moses Benson’s hoes? You ain’t
gone and changed off yo’ ole hoe for one his’n, I hope? You wouldn’t
do dat, if he is a skincher, an’ you a member ob de church, ’Liah Johnsing?”</p>

<p>“Mis’ Johnsing, you jes’ ten’ to yo’ own bus’ness. Don’ you let me
hear not one mo’ word ’bout dat hoe.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, as bedtime drew near, ’Liah rose and went into the house,
saying as he went:</p>

<p>“Got to go down to de sto’, Lucy. I forgot I got to mow Dawkinses
fiel’ to-morrow, an’ my whetstun’s clear down to de bone, an’
I’ve got to start off to-morrow ’fore sto’s open.”</p>

<p>’Liah had been gone hardly a minute, when Aunt Lucy called in a
tragic whisper to Paul, her oldest boy, six years of age.</p>

<p>“You Paul, come here quick, by yo’self.”</p>

<p>Paul, used to obeying, came promptly, and was drawn close up to
his mother on the settee. “Now, you Paul, I wonder kin I trust you
to do something for me?”</p>

<p>Paul, somewhat disturbed, kept discreetly silent.</p>

<p>“I wish you’s a little bigger, but de Lord will hol’ you up. Paul,
you listen. When yo’ paw comes home from the sto’ an’ we’s all gone
to bed and got to sleep—you hearin’, Paul?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“You get up still’s a mouse, an’ you go git dat hoe yo’ paw brought
home, an’ don’t you make no noise takin’ it down, an’ you kerry dat
hoe ober to Mr. Benson’s; an’ you take de hoe what’s hangin’ dar—dat’s
our hoe, Paul, dat yo’ paw left dar by ’stake—you take dat hoe
an’ bring it in the woodshed, an’ don’t you nebber tell yo’ paw nothin’
’bout it.”</p>

<p>The first sun rays were shining in at the window through the
morning-glories, the early breakfast was smoking on the table, the six
young Johnsons were struggling down in various stages of sleepiness,
Aunt Lucy was bending over the stove and ’Liah washing at the sink,
when a loud knock was heard at the kitchen door, which, being open,
disclosed Mr. Benson. By his side stood the village constable. In his
hand was an old and much battered hoe. ’Liah saw the hoe and his
upper jaw fell. Aunt Lucy’s gaze also was riveted on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Goliah Johnson,” said the constable, “you’re my prisoner. You
stole Mr. Benson’s hoe.”</p>

<p>“’Fore de Lord, Mr. Benson, I ain’t got yo’ hoe. What you doin’
wid mine?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t pretend that you left your old hoe in my barn yesterday
by mistake, ’Liah Johnson,” burst in Mr. Benson, “as if you couldn’t
tell this old thing from my hoe. What have you got to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“You may search dis place, Mr. Benson, from top to bottom an’ side
to side, an’ you won’t find no stiver of yo’ old hoe. How you got
mine I ’clare I give up, but you kin see fo’ yourself. Now, here’s
where I keeps my hoe,” and ’Liah swung open the woodshed door.</p>

<p>There hung Mr. Benson’s new hoe.</p>

<p>“You Paul!” fairly shouted Aunt Lucy, pouncing on her young hopeful,
“what did you do las’ night?”</p>

<p>“Did jist what you tol’ me. Took back dat hoe an’ changed it for de
one in Mr. Benson’s barn.”</p>

<p>“Took back what hoe?” shouted ’Liah in his turn. “Lucy Johnsing,
what you been stickin’ yo’ fingers in?”</p>

<p>“Well, ’Liah, I ’lowed I warn’t gwine to have no hoe in dis house
what didn’t b’long to us by rights, ’n’ so I tol’ Paul to get up las’
night an’ change de hoes back again, an’ if he did it, how dis one
comes heah beats me.”</p>

<p>“You Lucy Johnsing, see what you’s been an’ done wid yo’ meddlin’.
I took back dat hoe ’fore I went to bed, when I made ’s
though I was gettin’ de whetstun, an’ then you went and changed ’em
back ag’in.”</p>

<p>“’Liah Johnsing, why you keep secrets from yo’ wedded wife? Why
didn’t you tell me ’bout dat?”</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Benson saw that there was something more in the
matter than he supposed, and sending away the constable he got from
the worthy couple, with much circumlocution, the story of the night’s
mistakes. Being a man with some sense of humor, he was quite mollified
by the comicalities of the situation, and even went so far as to
take breakfast with the Johnsons.</p>

<p>“An’ after dis, ’Liah Johnsing,” was Aunt Lucy’s moral, “you’d better
think twice ’fore you keep any mo’ secrets from yo’ lawful wedded
wife!”</p>

<h5>WHEN THE LITTLE LADY FELL ILL</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anonymous</span></p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” there was a little lady, gentle and sweet. One
day she sent for the doctor. She was ill. She lay upon her bed with
her bronze hair afloat upon the pillow. She smiled as the doctor came
in and held out a hand tiny and soft and very white. Her teeth shone
between her crimson lips and there were beautiful violet lights in her
brown eyes. She was always full of life and spirit. Now here she
was in bed and sending for the doctor, she who had almost never before
needed a doctor. A great operation was decided upon. She only asked
how long she would be out of the sun. They thought the operation
would heal. But it did not—and there was another and another. For
a little while after each operation she did get back to the sun and was
very happy, just as a butterfly might be.</p>

<p>But at last they who watched knew that the frail little body could
not withstand another operation and that the end was near—very near.
Then came the fourteenth day of December, when, they told the young
doctor, it was his duty to tell the little butterfly. That night he walked
the streets—all the long night. It rained. But he did not feel it. In
the morning he understood why some must die, for in the rain and the
night he had unconsciously been with the God who gives and who takes
away. He went, gaunt with the night’s agony, but smiling, and took
the two little hands into his.</p>

<p>“Did you ever wonder,” he asked her, “as I have, why God gives
life only to take it away?”</p>

<p>“Just for love,” she smiled. “He wants the best Himself.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said, “that you are very ill?”</p>

<p>“Am I?” she said, suddenly turning her great, startled eyes upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you noticed,” he tried to go on, “that you—”</p>

<p>“No,” she said breathlessly. “You said I would get well—always
said it. And I knew that you knew, and I trusted you.”</p>

<p>“Doctors must do those things,” he pleaded, “because it keeps up the
patient’s courage. There is no medicine like hope.”</p>

<p>“I have never thought till now,” she halted, “that I would not get
well.”</p>

<p>“I have known it for a long time.”</p>

<p>“And you have been so sweet and brave so as to—”</p>

<p>“No, I have deceived you only that you might live a little longer.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a long time. Then she reached out and
touched his hand.</p>

<p>“Then you mean,” she whispered, “that—”</p>

<p>He closed her lips, and she understood.</p>

<p>“Poor doctor! It is dreadful to make you the bearer of such a
message.” She thought silently a long while. “At first I was inclined
to be cross at you for deceiving me. But now—” a tear presently stole
down each pale young cheek “—but now,” she ended in a whisper, “it
is wonderful—beautiful—very, very beautiful! One can hardly believe
that there are people who willingly bear the sorrows of others.”</p>

<p>“I have been only selfish, I wanted to keep you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered, “I understand.”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days, perhaps a week—two weeks.”</p>

<p>“No,” she cried suddenly, “for that is Christmas. And the house will
be sad—in mourning. No! You must make me live. You must make
them think I am getting well.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if we only could! But I must not deceive you any longer. I
said two weeks—but it will not be that long.”</p>

<p>“It will—it must be!” she said, suddenly rising in bed. “We will
pray God, and you will help, and I will. There must be some sort of
tonic—a stimulant—tell me—tell me there is! You must not spoil
their Christmas—on—on my account!”</p>

<p>She smiled a little at the odd ending of her phrase and dropped back
upon the pillow, flushed and brilliant, splendid, so that even the doctor
was deceived, and hoped.</p>

<p>“If you can do that—keep up such a vigor by hope and happiness, the
hope of happiness for others—perhaps, with God’s help, we can—do
what you wish.”</p>

<p>“Of course we can. I know it!”</p>

<p>“Then so do I, and you shall have the uttermost minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“And when it is done,”—the young spirit weakened,—“this, which
you gave me so long ago, shall be yours again—for a memory!”</p>

<p>She put his hand upon the ring which fitted her middle finger.</p>

<p>“A memory?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Of the bravest and sweetest man in the world,” she said, putting a
kiss upon the ring. “Oh! but I don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>She was so wonderful—with such a tremendous spirit in that brave
little body. The doctor thought she might even then get well.</p>

<p>And when he came again, she did seem well—quite well. Her cheeks
were pink, her lips crimson, her hair was coiled and dressed. She
smiled and said: “Paint!”</p>

<p>But the trick had deceived her family even more than it had deceived
the doctor. For, one by one they came in and, standing at the
foot of the bed, seeing the pretty little painted creature, they were sure
that she was getting better rapidly—was, in fact, almost well! Her
younger sister romped in and leaped upon the bed, crying: “See,
doctor! It is all as it used to be! And it has been so long since it
was all as it used to be. Dearest, soon we will be out on Saint
George’s Hill again, rolling together on the grass, down, down
and—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cooed the little patient rapturously, “soon—very soon—.”
But a sudden sob ended the incident.</p>

<p>“Thank you—oh! thank you so much, doctor, dear, for giving back
to me the sweetest sister in all, all the whole world!”</p>

<p>Day by day more paint was required to cover the growing pallor, and
always more and more. And always more drugs to keep the eyes
bright and the spirits from flagging. When the young doctor wasn’t
by her side he was studying—searching—until there was nothing in all
medical science for prolonging life which he did not know.</p>

<p>The house became gay again because of the lie that was practiced.
The noises which had been hushed when there was danger were
resumed.</p>

<p>There was at last a day when the doctor helped at the dressing and
painting; so near was the shadow that she might have flown at a
breath.</p>

<p>And so they put upon her, lying in their hands, wonderful garments
and ribbons and embroideries. And even the little hands on that day
had to be carefully “made up” to conceal the livid blue. Then when
all was ready, they sat her royally up in bed, lighted the candles, closed
the blinds and let the waiting family enter—for it was the day before
Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>They came to music—the moment the door was opened—bursting
with joy. A processional they made of it!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pilgrim through this barren land;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am weak, but Thou art mighty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hold me with Thy powerful hand.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Standing about her bed they sang that, and each separate heart was
welling a song of joy, because they thought she had come back to them!</p>

<p>Like those great ladies at Versailles, in the reign of the Grand
Monarch, who received in bed, she laughed, happy as the happiest of
them.</p>

<p>Then came another procession, down to the last servant in the house,
bearing gifts. Then flowers and green things—until the beautiful rose-embroidered
covering of her bed was lost to sight under the load of
flowers, and these in turn were blotted out with the gifts. Wonderful
gifts they were! How could they not be? They were welcoming with
them their best beloved back to life! On her neck was girded a chain,
on her fingers were put rings, and in her ears were hung gems, so that
she blazed with jewels. Before her lay a splendid, filmy dress, and
with it were hat and gloves and a gay parasol.</p>

<p>All—all, gifts of life!</p>

<p>And yet another procession came, bearing holly and mistletoe and
garlands and crimson berries, and last of all, a Christmas tree, all
lighted and glowing with a hundred pretty things. And almost in a
moment they transformed the room into a Christmas bower. The bed,
the walls, the floor, bloomed in the red and white and green of
Christmas.</p>

<p>So Christmas came—the gayest, the maddest, the saddest that house
had ever known.</p>

<p>But she had barely carried it through, and when the excitement
would pass the doctor knew that no stimulant devised by man could
keep her on the earth she had blessed an hour longer. Before the collapse
quite came, the doctor said:</p>

<p>“My patient is tired—”</p>

<p>“A little tired, yes,” she smiled at them. “To-morrow.”</p>

<p>So they all kissed the painted lips good-night and, wishing her a
happy to-morrow, went away.</p>

<p>The doctor moved to take the heavy gifts off the bed. She stopped
him with a tired smile and a shake of the head. It was all she could
do just then. Life was very low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“No,” she shook, “I want them all just as they are. Mamma said
to-morrow—” she halted.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Poor mamma!”</p>

<h5>THE FACE OF THE MASTER</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Myrtle Reed</span></p>

<p>In a little town in Italy there lived an old violin-maker whose only
pride and happiness was in the perfect instruments he made. He had
a little son called Pedro. Pedro was a dark little fellow with large,
brown eyes which seemed to hold a world of feeling and sometimes
sadness. He loved his mother dearly, but shrank somewhat from his
stern father, who was always so busy he hardly noticed him.</p>

<p>Pedro was errand boy for the little shop and tried to do his work
patiently, cheerfully and obediently. One day an unusually fine instrument
had been finished and the old man, in his joy and pride, held it
in position and touched the strings softly with the bow. Pedro, who
was sitting outside on the porch, heard the music and came running in
to hear it, but in his haste he did not see an exquisite piece of carving
on the floor and stepped upon it. Crack! it broke in two. Pedro’s
father became very angry and pushed him into his little bedroom and
turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>In the morning Pedro’s father called him very early, as he had many
errands for the boy to do. All day Pedro trudged wearily back and
forth for his father. He went about his work as if in a dream, thinking
always of the music he had heard and wishing with all his heart
that he might play. Night was coming on and Pedro was sitting on
the step outside resting, when his father told him he had yet another
errand for him to do. Pedro was very tired, yet he did not say anything
but went immediately on the errand. When he had delivered
the message, the man showed him a short cut home. As Pedro was
walking slowly home, he stopped suddenly as he heard the sound of
music. Could it be a violin? He listened to find from whence it
came. At last he decided it came from the little vine-covered cottage
across the lane. He walked slowly over and sat down under the open
window. The music was exquisite. As he listened he heard the soft
wind rustling through the trees, the sound of birds calling to one another
in the forest, the sound of rushing water as that of a river as it
flowed headlong into the ocean.</p>

<p>The music changed as he listened; he heard a soft, dreamy lullaby,
then again the sound of the ocean, of the waves beating upon the sand.
As he listened the music grew fainter, the moon came out from behind
the cloud and Pedro saw the face of the Master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>He was a bent old man with white hair and beautiful blue, shining
eyes. As the music ended in one long, sweet, trembling chord, Pedro
saw the Master bend his head over his violin, and as he quietly slipped
away he thought he heard the sound of sobbing.</p>

<p>Pedro walked the rest of the way home in a dream. As he came
into the work-shop he saw the beautiful violin and touched it tenderly,
caressingly. Oh, if he could only play! He went to bed, but could
not sleep. The beautiful music kept coming back again and again. At
last he arose, dressed himself and went into the work-shop. He picked
up the violin tenderly, lovingly, and went out to the orchard to where
a little brook ran merrily by. It was a beautiful night, calm and
peaceful, a soft wind whispered through the trees, through the stillness
the sweet, clear notes of a bird were heard. The witchery of the
night, its calmness and quiet beauty, seemed to want him to play. So
placing the violin in position, he ran the bow gently over the strings;
at first the notes were short, trembling, and broken. Soon it became
very beautiful, and still he played on and on. He did not notice that
day was dawning, and upon looking up he was frightened at seeing his
father standing before him. But his father smiled at him and said:</p>

<p>“My son, you are then a musician? The music was wonderful!”</p>

<p>Pedro smiled, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“You shall have lessons from the Master,” his father said. Pedro
could hardly believe it. Lessons from the Master! To learn to play!</p>

<p>After the day’s work was done Pedro and his father walked down
the same little, narrow street to the little vine-covered cottage that he
had seen the night before. Soon Pedro found himself in a little sitting-room
awaiting the Master. Soon the Master came, and Pedro’s
father said, “If you will teach my son to play I will make you the
most beautiful violin in the world.”</p>

<p>The Master was very well satisfied with his violin and he did not
like to teach. But he said to Pedro, “Do you like music?” Pedro
smiled, his whole soul in his eyes. The Master said, “Yes, you love
it, you shall play.”</p>

<p>The next day Pedro came for his first lesson. He enjoyed it very
much and soon mastered the tedious exercises.</p>

<p>So the years passed and Pedro had become famous. The Master
was growing old; still the most beautiful violin had not been completed.
One day Pedro came to visit the Master and the housekeeper
told him he was ill. Pedro waited, hoping the Master might want
him. Soon he returned home and began to play. While he was playing
his father told him that the Master’s violin was finished. Pedro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
smiled sadly and said, “The Master is ill.” That evening as he sat
playing a messenger came and summoned him to the Master’s house.
He took the finished violin with him, and as he looked into the Master’s
room he saw him lying there on a couch, so thin, and still, and
white. He smiled as Pedro entered, and said, “You have come to play
for me, my son? The night is so long and I am so tired. Play,
Pedro, play!” Pedro showed him the newly finished violin, but he
only smiled as he nodded for Pedro to begin.</p>

<p>Pedro played, and played, and played. In the music he interwove all
the trials, sorrows and happiness of his childhood, and his love for the
Master. A soft wind rustled through the trees, the sound of a little
brooklet was heard and the birds calling to one another in the forest.
It all ended with one trembling chord. When he had finished the
Master was sitting up in bed. “Pedro, where did you learn to play
that?”</p>

<p>Pedro smiled. “You taught me, Master. I always knew you must
have had some sorrow in your life or you never could have played so
exquisitely.”</p>

<p>The Master said: “You are right.” And then he told him of his
sorrowful and suffering life. “Play it again, Pedro. Now you understand.”</p>

<p>Pedro played, and played, and played. This time there was a sweetness
that somehow made the sad strain less noticeable. The Master
lay looking out of the window; day was breaking. As the last sweet,
trembling note died away, Pedro looked into the face of the Master.
There was a beautiful smile on his face. For the Master the trials
and sorrows of the world were over. Pedro knelt down before the
Master and kissed the thin, white hand reverently, the hand that had
made so many sad lives happy with beautiful music.</p>

<h5>VOICE FROM A FAR COUNTRY</h5>

<p>The old couple were very lonely as they sat in their little kitchen
that wintry afternoon. It was their daughter’s birthday, their only
child, who had left them to go to the great, glittering world on the far
side of the water. There she had won fame with her voice, while
they had stayed behind in the little village and tried to be cheerful
without her. Usually they succeeded pretty well, but this birthday, of
all days in the year, was the hardest to bear; even Christmas was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
so hard as this birthday, which brought so vividly to their minds the
memories of other birthdays—the first one when the baby’s coming
had found them awe-struck with the joy and wonder of it all, and
each succeeding year, as their treasure grew to girlhood and from a
girl to a sweet and winning woman, then faded from their sight.</p>

<p>They had not seen her since, for money was scarce and time valuable.
She must work very hard, so she wrote them. The old couple
tried to keep up a conversation as they sat in the kitchen that wintry
afternoon, but failed miserably. Finally after a long silence the old
man rose and said:</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll get the chores done before it storms, mother. Coming
on to snow fast.”</p>

<p>“All right, father, I’ll have supper ready for you when you come in.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t hurry about supper. Guess I’ll go to the post-office
after I get the critters fed. There might be a letter from Milly.”</p>

<p>“All right, father.”</p>

<p>There was a new note in the woman’s voice, for this was just what
she had been wishing her husband to do, but had not liked to have
him take the long trip to the post-office with the weather so threatening.</p>

<p>The old man went out, and the woman began to prepare the supper.
Twilight had come and she lighted an old-fashioned lamp, so clean
that it sparkled. As she set the table she hummed the refrain of a
lullaby, a little song she had often crooned when her arms had not
been empty.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door flew open, letting in great gusts of wintry wind.</p>

<p>“Hurry and get that door shut, Pa. Warn’t there no letters?”</p>

<p>“No, but there’s this.”</p>

<p>The old man was carrying an old box almost too large for him to
handle.</p>

<p>“When I went to the post-office I found there warn’t no letter and
I was considerably disappointed, but as I was going by Jones’s store,
Jones he comes to the door and says he, ‘Say, Si, there’s a box in here
fer you!’ ‘Fer me?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘It come this afternoon by express, and I guess by the looks of it,
it’s from your daughter in forin’ parts,’ said he.</p>

<p>“So here ’tis, and now, mother, where’s the hatchet?”</p>

<p>The hatchet was brought and the box was opened.</p>

<p>“My, what a funny lookin’ thing! Looks like a small size sewing
machine, and here’s a brass horn, too. I wonder if Milly sent that for
a joke or what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>Silas set the carved case of polished wood on the table, and the old
couple gazed in puzzled astonishment at what they saw under it.
After a silence the old man said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps there are some directions.” Going over to the box he
found, as he had prophesied, a paper of instructions.</p>

<p>“It’s a—P-H-O-N-O-G-R-A-P-H, and them there things air records.
Well, I know about as much as I did afore. I’ll follow out the directions
and see what happens. Wish I knew what it was; ’tain’t no kind
of a farm implement, that’s sartin, nor a potater parer, nor sewing
machine. Well, we’ll follow these rules and see what she does.”</p>

<p>The faces of the old couple were full of interest, as Silas attached
the spring and set the phonograph in motion. At first there was a
peculiar buzzing sound, but nothing unusual happened, and the old
people were beginning to look disappointed when, after the buzzing,
came the sound of a voice singing. Surprise, wonder, amazement,
succeeded each other on the old faces, as the first notes of “Home,
Sweet Home” fell on their startled ears.</p>

the water.</p>

<h5>LITTLE BROTHER</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Madeleine Z. Doty</span></p>

<p class="center smaller">A TRUE STORY</p>

<p>It was a warm summer’s day in late August. No men were visible
in the Belgian hamlet. The women reaped in the fields; the insects
hummed in the dry, warm air; the house-doors stood open. On a bed
in a room in one of the cottages lay a woman. Beside her sat a small
boy. He was still, but alert, his eyes following the buzzing flies.
With a bit of paper he drove the intruders from the bed. His mother
slept. It was evident from the pale, drawn face that she was ill.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dreaming, silent, summer day was broken by the sound
of clattering hoofs. Some one was riding hurriedly through the town.</p>

<p>The woman moved uneasily. Her eyes opened. She smiled at the
little boy.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p>The boy went to the window. Women were gathering in the street.
He told his mother and hurried from the room. Her eyes grew troubled.
In a few minutes the child was back, breathless and excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother, the Germans are coming!”</p>

<p>The woman braced herself against the shock. At first she hardly
grasped the news. Then her face whitened, her body quivered and
became convulsed. Pain sprang to her eyes, driving out fear; beads
of perspiration stood on her forehead; a little animal cry of pain
broke from her lips. The boy gazed at her paralyzed, horrified; then
he flung himself down beside the bed and seized his mother’s hand.</p>

<p>“What is it, mother, what is it?”</p>

<p>The paroxysm of pain passed; the woman’s body relaxed, her hand
reached for the boy’s head and stroked it. “It’s all right, my son.”
Then as the pain began again, “Quick, sonny, bring auntie.”</p>

<p>The boy darted from the room. Auntie was the woman-doctor of
B——. He found her in the Square. The townspeople were wildly
excited. The Germans were coming. But the boy thought only of
his mother. He tugged at auntie’s sleeve. His frenzied efforts at
last caught her attention. She saw he was in need and went with
him.</p>

<p>Agonizing little moans issued from the house as they entered. In
an instant the midwife understood. She wanted to send the boy away,
but she must have help. Who was there to fetch and carry? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
neighbors, terrified at their danger, were making plans for departure.
She let the boy stay.</p>

<p>Through the succeeding hour a white-faced little boy worked manfully.
His mother’s cries wrung his childish heart. Why did babies
come this way? He could not understand. Would she die? Had
his birth given such pain? If only she could speak! And once, as if
realizing his necessity, his mother did speak.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, my son; it will soon be over.”</p>

<p>That message brought comfort; but his heart failed when the end
came. He rushed to the window and put his little hands tight over
his ears. It was only for a moment. He was needed. His mother’s
moans had ceased and a baby’s cry broke the stillness.</p>

<p>The drama of birth passed, the midwife grew restless. She became
conscious of the outer world. There were high, excited voices; wagons
clattered over stones; moving-day had descended on the town. She
turned to the window. Neighbors with wheelbarrows and carts piled
high with household possessions hurried by. They beckoned to her.</p>

<p>For a moment the woman hesitated. She looked at the mother on
the bed, nestling her babe to her breast; then the panic of the outside
world seized her. Quickly she left the room.</p>

<p>The small boy knelt at his mother’s bedside, his little face against
hers. Softly he kissed the pale cheek. The boy’s heart had become a
man’s. He tried by touch and look to speak his love, his sympathy,
his admiration. His mother smiled at him as she soothed the baby,
glad to be free from pain. But presently the shouts and disorder of
the departing townspeople reached her ears. She stirred uneasily.
Fear crept into her eyes. Passionately she strained her little one to her.</p>

<p>“How soon, little son, how soon?”</p>

<p>The lad, absorbed in his mother, had forgotten the Germans. With
a start he realized the danger. His new-born manhood took command.
His father was at the front. He must protect his mother and tiny
sister. His mother was too ill to move, but they ought to get away.
Who had a wagon? He hurried to the window, but already even the
stragglers were far down the road. All but three of the horses had
been sent to the front. Those three were now out of sight with their
overloaded wagons. The boy stood stupefied and helpless. The
woman on the bed stirred.</p>

<p>“My son,” she called. “My son!”</p>

<p>He went to her.</p>

<p>“You must leave me and go on.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The woman drew the boy down beside her. She knew the struggle
to come. How could she make him understand that his life and the
baby’s meant more to her than her own? Lovingly she stroked the
soft cheek. It was a grave, determined little face with very steady
eyes.</p>

<p>“Son, dear, think of little sister. The Germans won’t bother with
babies. There isn’t any milk. Mother hasn’t any for her. You must
take baby in your strong little arms and run—run with her right out
of this land into Holland.”</p>

<p>But he could not be persuaded. The mother understood that love
and a sense of duty held him. She gathered the baby in her arms and
tried to rise, but the overtaxed heart failed, and she fell back half-fainting.
The boy brought water and bathed her head until the tired
eyes opened.</p>

<p>“Little son, it will kill mother if you don’t go.”</p>

<p>The boy’s shoulders shook. He knelt by the bed. A sob broke from
him. Then there came the faint, far-distant call of the bugle. Frantically
the mother gathered up her baby and held it out to the boy.</p>

<p>“For mother’s sake, son, for mother.”</p>

<p>In a flash the boy understood. His mother had risked her life for
the tiny sister. She wanted the baby saved more than anything else
in the world. He dashed the tears from his eyes. He wound his arms
about his mother in a long, passionate embrace.</p>

<p>“I’ll take her, mother; I’ll get her there safely.”</p>

<p>The bugle grew louder. Through the open window on the far-distant
road could be seen a cloud of dust. There was not a moment
to lose. Stooping, the boy caught up the red, squirming baby. Very
tenderly he placed the little body against his breast and buttoned his
coat over his burden.</p>

<p>The sound of marching feet could now be heard. Swiftly he ran to
the door. As he reached the threshold he turned. His mother, her
eyes shining with love and hope, was waving a last good-by. Down
the stairs, out of the back door, and across the fields sped the child.
Over grass and across streams flew the sure little feet. His heart
tugged fiercely to go back, but that look in his mother’s face sustained
him.</p>

<p>He knew the road to Holland. It was straight to the north; but he
kept to the fields. He didn’t want the baby discovered. Mile after
mile, through hour after hour, he pushed on, until twilight came. He
found a little spring and drank thirstily. Then he moistened the baby’s
mouth. The little creature was very good. Occasionally she uttered a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
feeble cry, but most of the time she slept. The boy was intensely
weary. His feet ached. He sat down under a great tree and leaned
against it. Was it right to keep a baby out all night? Ought he to
go to some farmhouse? If he did, would the people take baby away?
His mother had said, “Run straight to Holland.” But Holland was
twenty miles away. He opened his coat and looked at the tiny creature.
She slept peacefully.</p>

<p>The night was very warm. He decided to remain where he was.
It had grown dark. The trees and bushes loomed big. His heart beat
quickly. He was glad of the warm, soft, live little creature in his
arms. He had come on this journey for his mother, but suddenly his
boy’s heart opened to the tiny, clinging thing at his breast. His little
hand stroked the baby tenderly. Then he stooped, and softly his lips
touched the red, wrinkled face. Presently his little body relaxed, and
he slept. He had walked eight miles. Through the long night the
deep sleep of exhaustion held him. He lay quite motionless, head and
shoulders resting against the tree-trunk, and the new-born babe enveloped
in the warmth of his body and arms slept also. The feeble cry of
the child woke him. The sun was coming over the horizon and the
air was alive with the twitter of birds.</p>

<p>At first he thought he was at home and had awakened to a long
happy summer’s day. Then the fretful little cries brought back memory
with a rush. His new-born love flooded him. Tenderly he laid
the little sister down. Stretching his stiff and aching body, he hurried
for water. Very carefully he put a few drops in the little mouth
and wet the baby’s lips with his little brown finger. This proved
soothing and the cries ceased. The tug of the baby’s lips on his finger
clutched his heart. The helpless little thing was hungry, and he
too was desperately hungry. What should he do? His mother had
spoken of milk. He must get milk. Again he gathered up his burden
and buttoned his coat. From the rising ground on which he stood
he could see a farmhouse with smoke issuing from its chimney. He
hurried down to the friendly open door. A kind woman gave him
food. She recognized him as a little refugee bound for Holland. He
had difficulty in concealing the baby, but fortunately she did not cry.
The woman saw that he carried something, but when he asked for
milk she concluded he had a pet kitten. He accepted this explanation.
Eagerly he took the coveted milk and started on.</p>

<p>But day-old babies do not know how to drink. When he dropped
milk into the baby’s mouth she choked and sputtered. He had to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
content with moistening her mouth and giving her a milk-soaked finger.</p>

<p>Refreshed by sleep and food, the boy set off briskly. Holland did
not now seem so far off. If only his mother were safe! Had the
Germans been good to her? These thoughts pursued and tormented
him. As before, he kept off the beaten track, making his way through
open meadows and patches of trees. But as the day advanced, the heat
grew intense. His feet ached, his arms ached, and, worst of all, the
baby cried fretfully.</p>

<p>At noon he came to a little brook sheltered by trees. He sat down
on the bank and dangled his swollen feet in the cool, fresh stream.
But his tiny sister still cried. Suddenly a thought came to him. Placing
the baby on his knees, he undid the towel that enveloped her.
There had been no time for clothes. Then he dipped a dirty pocket-handkerchief
in the brook and gently sponged the hot, restless little
body. Very tenderly he washed the little arms and legs. That successfully
accomplished, he turned the tiny creature and bathed the
small back. Evidently this was the proper treatment, for the baby
grew quiet. His heart swelled with pride. Reverently he wrapped
the towel around the naked little one and, administering a few drops
of milk, again went on.</p>

<p>All through that long, hot afternoon he toiled. His footsteps grew
slower and slower; he covered diminishing distances. Frequently he
stopped to rest, and now the baby had begun again to cry fitfully. At
one time his strength failed. Then he placed the baby under a tree
and rising on his knees uttered a prayer:</p>

<p>“O God, she’s such a little thing, help me to get her there.”</p>

<p>Like a benediction came the cool breeze of the sunset hour, bringing
renewed strength.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the afternoon of the following day a wagon stopped before a Belgian
refugee-camp in Holland. Slowly and stiffly a small boy slid to
the ground. He had been picked up just over the border by a friendly
farmer, and driven to camp. He was dirty, bedraggled and footsore.
Very kindly the ladies’ committee received him. He was placed at the
table and a bowl of hot soup was set before him. He ate awkwardly
with his left hand. His right hand held something beneath his coat,
which he never for a moment forgot. The women tried to get his
story, but he remained strangely silent. His eyes wandered over the
room and back to their faces. He seemed to be testing them. Not
for an hour, not until there was a faint stirring in his coat, did he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
disclose his burden. Then, going to her whom he had chosen as most
to be trusted, he opened his jacket. In a dirty towel lay a naked, miserably
thin, three-days’-old baby.</p>

<p>Mutely holding out the forlorn object, the boy begged help. Bit by
bit they got his story. Hurriedly a Belgian refugee mother was sent
for. She was told what had happened, and she took the baby to her
breast. Jealously the boy stood guard while his tiny sister had her
first meal. But the spark of life was very low.</p>

<p>For two days the camp concentrated on the tiny creature. The boy
never left his sister’s side. But her ordeal had been too great. It
was only a feeble flicker of life at best, and during the third night the
little flame went out. The boy was utterly crushed. He had now but
one thought—to reach his mother. It was impossible to keep the news
from him longer. He would have gone in search. Gently he was told
of the skirmish that had destroyed the Belgian hamlet. There were
no houses or people in the town that had once been his home.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“That is his story,” ended the friendly little Dutch woman.</p>

<p>“And his father?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Killed at the front,” was the reply.</p>

<p>I rose to go, but could not get the boy out of my mind. What a
world! What intolerable suffering! Was there no way out? Then
the ever-recurring phrase of the French and Belgian soldiers came to
me. When I had shuddered at ghastly wounds, at death, at innumerable
white crosses on a bloody battlefield, invariably, in dry, cynical,
hopeless tones, the soldier would make the one comment,—</p>

<p>“<i>C’est la guerre; que voulez-vous?</i>”—“It is war; what would you?”</p>

<h5>BROWN WOLF</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Jack London</span></p>

<p>The Klondiker’s face took on a contemptuous expression as he said
finally, “I reckon there’s nothin’ in sight to prevent me takin’ the dog
right here an’ now.”</p>

<p>Walt’s face reddened, and the striking-muscles of his arms and
shoulders seemed to stiffen and grow tense. His wife fluttered apprehensively
into the breach.</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Miller is right,” she said. “I’m afraid that he is.
Wolf does seem to know him, and certainly he answers to the name
of Brown. He made friends with him instantly, and you know that’s
something he never did with anybody before. Besides, look at the
way he barked. He was bursting with joy. Joy over what? Without
doubt at finding Mr. Miller.”</p>

<p>Walt’s striking-muscles relaxed, and his shoulders seemed to droop
with hopelessness.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Madge,” he said. “Wolf isn’t Wolf, but
Brown, and he must belong to Mr. Miller.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Miller will sell him?” she suggested. “We can buy
him.”</p>

<p>Skiff Miller shook his head, no longer belligerent, but kindly, quick
to be generous in response to generousness.</p>

<p>“I had five dogs,” he said, casting about for the easiest way to temper
his refusal. “He was the leader. They was the crack team of
Alaska. Nothin’ could touch ’em. In 1898 I refused five thousand
dollars for the bunch. Dogs was high then anyway; but that wasn’t
what made the fancy price. It was the team itself. Brown was the
best in the team. That winter I refused twelve hundred for him. I
didn’t sell ’m then an’ I ain’t a-sellin’ ’m now. Besides, I think a
mighty lot of that dog. I’ve ben lookin’ for ’m for three years. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
made me fair sick when I found he’d ben stole—not the value of him,
but the—well, I liked ’m. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I seen ’m
just now. I thought I was dreamin’. It was too good to be true.
Why, I was his wet-nurse. I put ’m to bed, snug every night. His
mother died, and I brought ’m up on condensed milk at two dollars a
can when I couldn’t afford it in my own coffee. He never knew any
mother but me.”</p>

<p>Madge began to speak:</p>

<p>“But the dog,” she said. “You haven’t considered the dog.”</p>

<p>Skiff Miller looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Have you thought about him?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t know what you’re drivin’ at,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Maybe the dog has some choice in the matter,” Madge went on.
“Maybe he has his likes and desires. You have not considered him.
You give him no choice. It had never entered your mind that possibly
he might prefer California to Alaska. You consider only what
you like. You do with him as you would with a sack of potatoes or a
bale of hay.”</p>

<p>This was a new way of looking at it, and Miller was visibly impressed
as he debated it in his mind. Madge took advantage of his
indecision.</p>

<p>“If you really love him, what would be happiness to him would be
your happiness also,” she urged.</p>

<p>Skiff Miller continued to debate with himself, and Madge stole a
glance of exultation to her husband, who looked back warm approval.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” the Klondiker suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>It was her turn to be puzzled. “What do you mean?” she asked.</p>

<p>“D’ye think he’d sooner stay in California?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head with positiveness. “I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>Skiff Miller again debated with himself, though this time aloud, at
the same time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted
animal.</p>

<p>“He was a good worker. He’s done a heap of work for me. He
never loafed on me, an’ he was a joe-dandy at hammerin’ a raw team
into shape. He’s got a head on him. He can do everything but talk.
He knows what you say to him. Look at ’m now. He knows we’re
talkin’ about him.”</p>

<p>The dog was lying at Skiff Miller’s feet, head close down on paws,
ears erect and listening, and eyes that were quick and eager to follow
the sound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“An’ there’s a lot of work in ’m yet. He’s good for years to come.
An’ I do like him.”</p>

<p>Once or twice after that Skiff Miller opened his mouth and closed
it again without speaking. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Your remarks, ma’am, has some weight
in them. The dog’s worked hard, and maybe he’s earned a soft berth
an’ has got a right to choose. Anyway, we’ll leave it up to him.
Whatever he says goes. You people stay right here settin’ down; I’ll
say ‘good-by’ and walk off casual-like. If he wants to stay, he can
stay. If he wants to come with me, let ’m come. I won’t call ’m to
come an’ don’t you call ’m to come back.”</p>

<p>He looked with sudden suspicion at Madge, and added, “Only you
must play fair. No persuadin’ after my back is turned.”</p>

<p>“We’ll play fair,” Madge began, but Skiff Miller broke in on her
assurances.</p>

<p>“I know the ways of women,” he announced. “Their hearts is soft.
When their hearts is touched they’re likely to stack the cards, look
at the bottom of the deck, an’ lie—beggin’ your pardon, ma’am—I’m
only discoursin’ about women in general.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you,” Madge quavered.</p>

<p>“I don’t see as you’ve got any call to thank me,” he replied; “Brown
ain’t decided yet. Now, you won’t mind if I go away slow. It’s no
more’n fair, seein’ I’ll be out of sight inside a hundred yards.”</p>

<p>Madge agreed and added, “And I promise you faithfully that we
won’t do anything to influence him.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I might as well be gettin’ along,” Skiff Miller said,
in the ordinary tones of one departing.</p>

<p>At this change in his voice Wolf lifted his head quickly, and still
more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands.
He sprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore-paws on her hip and
at the same time licking Skiff Miller’s hand. When the latter shook
hands with Walt, Wolf repeated his act, resting his weight on Walt
and licking both men’s hands.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no picnic, I can tell you that,” were the Klondiker’s last
words, as he turned and went slowly up the trail.</p>

<p>For the distance of twenty feet Wolf watched him go, himself all
eagerness and expectancy, as though waiting for the man to turn and
retrace his steps. Then, with a quick, low whine, Wolf sprang after
him, overtook him, caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant
tenderness and strove gently to make him pause.</p>

<p>Failing in this, Wolf raced back to where Walt Irvine sat, catching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
his coat-sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the
retreating man.</p>

<p>Wolf’s perturbation began to wax. He desired ubiquity. He wanted
to be in two places at the same time, with the old master and the
new, and steadily the distance was increasing. He sprang about excitedly,
making short, nervous leaps and twists, now toward one, now
toward the other, in painful indecision, not knowing his own mind,
desiring both and unable to choose, uttering quick, sharp whines and
beginning to pant.</p>

<p>He sat down abruptly on his haunches, thrusting his nose upward,
his mouth opening and closing with jerky movements, each time opening
wider. The jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent
spasms that attacked the throat, each spasm severer and more intense
than the preceding one. And in accord with jerks and spasms the
larynx began to vibrate, at first silently, accompanied by the rush of
air expelled from the lungs, then sounding a low, deep note, the
lowest in the register of the human ear. All this was the nervous
and muscular preliminary to howling.</p>

<p>But just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full
throat, the wide open mouth was closed, the paroxysms ceased, and
he looked long and steadily at the retreating man. Suddenly Wolf
turned his head, and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded Walt.
The appeal was unanswered. Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive,
no suggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be.</p>

<p>A glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of
the trail excited him again. He sprang to his feet with a whine, and
then, struck by a new idea, turned his attention to Madge. Hitherto
he had ignored her, but now, both masters failing him, she alone was
left. He went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap, nudging
her arm with his nose—an old trick of his when begging for favors.
He backed away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully,
curveting and prancing, half rearing and striking his fore-paws to the
earth, struggling with all his body, from the wheedling eyes and flattening
ears to the wagging tail, to express the thought that was in him
and that was denied him utterance.</p>

<p>This too he soon abandoned. He was depressed by the coldness of
these humans who had never been cold before. No response could
he draw from them, no help could he get. They did not consider
him. They were as dead.</p>

<p>He turned and silently gazed after the old master. Skiff Miller
was rounding the curve. In a moment he would be gone from view.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Yet he never turned his head, plodding straight onward; slowly and
methodically, as though possessed of no interest in what was occurring
behind his back.</p>

<p>And in this fashion he went out of view. Wolf waited for him to
reappear. He waited a long minute, quietly, silently without movement
as though turned to stone—withal stone quick with eagerness
and desire. He barked once, and waited. Then he turned and trotted
back to Walt Irvine. He sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily
at his feet, watching the trail where it curved emptily from view.</p>

<p>The tiny stream slipping down the mossy-lipped stone seemed suddenly
to increase the volume of its gurgling noise. Save for the
meadow larks, there was no other sound. The great yellow butterflies
drifted silently through the sunshine and lost themselves in the
drowsy shadows. Madge gazed triumphantly at her husband.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Wolf got upon his feet. Decision and deliberation
marked his movements. He did not glance at the man and
woman. His eyes were fixed up the trail. He had made up his mind.
They knew it. And they knew, so far as they were concerned, that
the ordeal had just begun.</p>

<p>He broke into a trot and Madge’s lips pursed, forming an avenue
for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth. But
the caressing sound was not made. She was impelled to look at her
husband, and she saw the sternness with which he watched her. The
pursed lips relaxed, and she sighed inaudibly.</p>

<p>Wolf’s trot broke into a run. Wider and wider were the leaps he
made. Not once did he turn his head, his wolf’s brush standing out
straight behind him. He cut sharply across the curve of the trail
and was gone.—From “Love of Life,” copyrighted by <i>The Macmillan

<h5>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Wilson Barrett</span></p>

<p>It was a festival day in Rome. Nero had decreed it. In the Circus
was to be given a performance the like of which had never before
been witnessed. The whole city was excited by the rumors of the
numbers of Christians doomed to die, and of the ferocity of the beasts
they were to encounter.</p>

<p>The dungeon beneath the amphitheatre in which the Christians were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
imprisoned was a large, gloomy, stone vault, destitute of furniture of
any kind.</p>

<p>Great was the contrast between the dark, damp cell and the sunlit
arena, crowded with eager, gayly dressed patricians. In the dungeon
were scores of men and women waiting for the signal to pass forth
to a certain and cruel death; in the auditorium was a seething mass
of humanity, thousands upon thousands impatiently awaiting their coming
forth, and gloating already in imagination upon the horrors they
must undergo.</p>

<p>The roars of the hungry beasts could be faintly heard, even when
the doors were closed; so could the equally merciless howls of the
blood-thirsty populace. How they were to die had not been told
the martyrs; only this they knew, that they were to die, and that every
endeavor would be made to make their deaths as horrible, revolting
and cruel as possible.</p>

<p>Among them were a few that trembled and felt sick with physical
fear, but not one murmured. Their eyes were mentally fixed upon
the Cross.</p>

<p>Again there was a loud call of the trumpets. The doors were thrown
open, and the arena beyond could be seen by the prisoners, flooded
with golden sunshine.</p>

<p>“Now, then, march!”</p>

<p>For a moment there was a pause, but almost before it could be
realized Mercia’s clear, sweet voice rang out the first words of their
beloved hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shepherd of souls that stumble by the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pilot of vessels storm-tossed in the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Healer of wounds, for help to Thee we pray.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Singing these words with uplifted eyes and undaunted hearts, those
noble martyrs went calmly and resignedly through the dark Valley
of the Shadow of Death to the everlasting peace that awaited them
beyond.</p>

<p>Mercia, a beautiful girl, was left alone in the dungeon. It was
generally understood that Marcus Superbus, the handsome, wealthy
young Prefect of Rome, was madly in love with this Christian girl,
and the adventuress who hoped to entrap Marcus prevailed upon Nero
to make Mercia’s punishment unique and horrible.</p>

<p>She sank upon her knees with her face pressed against the iron
bars. Presently the door leading to the corridor was unbarred. Two
officers entered, ushering in Marcus, who started on finding Mercia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
alone. Dismissing the guards, he closed the door and gazed with
infinite tenderness upon the white figure at his feet—Mercia.</p>

<p>For a time Marcus could not speak; his heart felt like bursting with
grief for this beautiful girl. Here in this loathsome dungeon she
could still preserve her courage and could still pray for forgiveness
for her persecutors.</p>

<p>“Mercia! Mercia!”</p>

<p>“What would you with me?”</p>

<p>“I came to save thee. I have knelt to Nero for thy pardon. He
will grant it upon one condition—that thou dost renounce thy false
worship—”</p>

<p>“It is not false! It is true and everlasting.”</p>

<p>“Everlasting? Nothing is everlasting! There is no after-life; the
end is here. Men come and go; they drink their little cup of woe or
happiness, and then sleep—the sleep that knows no awakening.”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure of that? Ask thyself, are there no inward monitors
that silently teach thee there is a life to come?”</p>

<p>“All men have wishes for a life to come, if it could better this.”</p>

<p>“It <i>will</i> better this, if this life be <i>well</i> lived. Hast thou lived well?”</p>

<p>“No; thou hast taught me that I never knew the shame of sin until
I knew thy purity. Ah! whence comes thy wondrous grace?”</p>

<p>“If I have any grace it comes from Him who died on Calvary’s
cross that grace might come to all.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost believe this?”</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> believe it.”</p>

<p>“But thou hast no proof.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The proof is here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thou dost believe so? All men, all nations have their gods.
This one bows down to a thing of stone, and calls it his god; another
to the sun, and calls it his god. A god of brass—a god of gold—a god
of wood. Each tells himself <i>his</i> is the <i>true</i> god. All are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“All <i>are</i> mistaken.”</p>

<p>“And thou? What is thy God? A fantasy—a vision—a superstition.
Wilt thou die for <i>such</i> a thing?”</p>

<p>“I will die for my Master gladly.”</p>

<p>“Mercia, hear me! Thou shalt <i>not</i> die! I cannot let thee go! I
love you so! I love you so!”</p>

<p>“Thou hast told me so before, and wouldst have slain thy soul and
mine.”</p>

<p>“I grant it. I did not know. I was blind! Now I see my love for
thee is love indeed. The brute is dead in me, the man is living. Thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
purity that I would have smirched hath cleansed me. Live, Mercia!
Live and be my wife!”</p>

<p>“Thy wife? Thy wife? Oh, Marcus, hear me. This love I speak
of came, I know not whence, nor how, then; now I know it came
from Him who gave me life. I receive it joyfully because He gave
it. Think you He gave it to tempt me to betray Him? Nay, Marcus,
He gave it to me to uphold and strengthen me. I will be true to
Him!”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt love?”</p>

<p>“I will not deny Him who died for me!”</p>

<p>“Mercia, if thy God exists He made us both, the one for the other.
Hearken! I am rich beyond all riches. I have power, skill, strength;
with these the world would be my slave, my vassal. Nero is hated,
loathed—is tottering on his throne. I have friends in plenty who
would help me—the throne of Cæsar might be mine—and thou shalt
share it with me if thou wilt but live. The crown of an Empress shall
deck that lovely head if thou wilt but live—only consent to live!”</p>

<p>“My crown is not of earth, Marcus; it awaits me there.”</p>

<p>“I cannot part from thee and live, Mercia! I have, to save thy
precious life, argued and spoken against thy faith, thy God, but to
speak truth to thee, I have been sorely troubled since I first saw thee.
Strange yearnings of the spirit come in the lonely watches of the
night; I battle with them, but they will not yield. I tremble with
strange fears, strange thoughts, strange hopes. If thy faith be true,
what is this world?—a little tarrying-place, a tiny bridge between two
vast eternities, that from which we have traveled, that towards which
we go. Oh, but to know! How can I know, Mercia? Teach me how
to know!”</p>

<p>“Look at the Cross, and pray, ‘Help Thou my unbelief.’ Give up
all that thou hast, and follow Him!”</p>

<p>“Would He welcome even me?”</p>

<p>“Yea, even thee, Marcus.”</p>

<p>Now there sounded on their ears another call from the trumpets.
The brazen doors slid back, the guards entered, followed this time
by Tigellinus.</p>

<p>“Prefect, the hour has come. Cæsar would have this maid’s decision.
Doth she renounce Christus and live, or cling to him and die?”</p>

<p>“Mercia, answer him!”</p>

<p>“I cling to Him and die. Farewell, Marcus!”</p>

<p>“No, not ‘Farewell.’ Death cannot part us. I, too, am ready!
My lingering doubts are dead; the light hath come! Return to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Cæsar; tell him Christus hath triumphed. Marcus, too, is a Christian.”</p>

<p>His face shone with the same glorious radiance that had transfigured
the features of Mercia. They were glorified by the presence
of Him who had promised to them, even as He had promised to the
penitent thief dying on the Cross beside Him—“Verily, I say unto thee,
this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”</p>

<h5>THE LITTLE FIR TREE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Hans Christian Andersen</span></p>

<p>Once there was a Little Fir Tree, slim and pointed and shiny, which
stood in a forest in the midst of some big fir trees, broad and tall and
shadowy green. The Little Fir Tree was very unhappy because he
was not big like the others. When the birds came flying into the
woods and lit on the branches of the big trees, and built their nests
there, he used to call up to them, “Come down, come down, rest in
my branches!” But they always said, “Oh, no, no, you are too little.”</p>

<p>And when the splendid wind came blowing and singing through the
forest, it bent and rocked and swung the tops of the big trees and
murmured to them. Then the Little Fir Tree looked up and called—“Oh,
please, dear wind, come down and play with me!” But he always
said, “Oh, no, you are too little, you are too little.” And in the winter
the white snow fell softly, softly, and covered the great trees all over
with wonderful caps and coats of white. The Little Fir Tree close
down in the cover of the others would call up, “Oh, please, dear snow,
give me a cap too! I want to play too!” But the snow always said—“Oh,
no, no, no, you are too little, you are too little.”</p>

<p>The worst of all was when men came with sledges and teams of
horses. They came to cut the big trees and carry them away. And
when one had been cut down and carried away, the others talked about
it, and nodded their heads. And the Little Fir Tree listened, and heard
them say that when you were carried away so, you might become the
mast of a mighty ship and go far away over the ocean and see many
wonderful things, or you might be a part of a fine house in a great
city and see much of life. The Little Fir Tree wanted greatly to see
life but he was always too little; the men passed him by. But, by
and by, one cold winter’s morning, men came with a sledge and horses
and after they had cut here and there, they came to the circle of trees
round the Little Fir Tree and looked all about. “There are none little
enough,” they said. Oh! how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
needles. “Here is one,” said one of the men; “it is just little enough.”
And he touched the Little Fir Tree. The little Fir Tree was happy
as a bird, because he knew they were about to cut him down. And
when he was being carried away on the sledge he lay wondering so
contentedly whether he should be the mast of a ship or part of a fine
house in the city. But when they came to the town he was taken out
and set upright in a tub and placed on the edge of a sidewalk in a
row of other fir trees all small, but none so little as he. And then the
Little Fir Tree began to see life. People kept coming to look at the
trees and take them away, but always when they saw the Little Fir
Tree, they shook their heads and said, “It is too little, too little!”
Until finally two children came along, hand in hand, looking carefully
at all the small trees. When they saw the Little Fir Tree, they cried
out, “We’ll take this one; it is just little enough!” They took him
out of his tub and carried him away between them. And the happy
Little Fir Tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that he
was just little enough for; he knew it could hardly be a mast or a
house since he was going away with children. He kept wondering
while they took him in through some big doors and set him up in another
tub on the table in a bare little room. Pretty soon they went
away and came back again with a big basket carried between them.
Then some pretty ladies, with white caps on their heads and white
aprons over their blue dresses, came bringing little parcels. The children
took things out of the basket and began to play with the Little
Fir Tree, just as he had often wished the birds and wind and snow
to do; he felt their soft little touches on his head and his twigs and
his branches, and when he looked down at himself, as far as he could
look, he saw that he was all hung with gold and silver chains!</p>

<p>There were strings of fluffy white stuff drooping around him. His
twigs held little gold nuts and pink rosy balls and silver stars. He
had little pink and white candles in his arms, but last and most wonderful
of all, the children hung a beautiful white floating doll angel over
his head! The Little Fir Tree could not breathe for joy and wonder.
What was it that he was now? Why was this glory for him? After
a time every one went away and left him. It grew dusk and the
Little Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors.
Sometimes he heard a child crying. He was beginning to be lonely.
It grew more and more shadowy. All at once the doors opened and
the two children came in. Two of the pretty ladies were with them.
They came to the Little Fir Tree and quickly lighted all the pink and
white candles. Then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the Little Fir Tree on it and pushed it, very smoothly and quickly,
out of the doors, across a hall and in at another door. The Little Fir
Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little white beds
in it, of children propped up on pillows in the beds, and of other
children in great wheel chairs and others hobbling about or sitting in
little chairs. He wondered why all the little children looked so white
and tired; he did not know he was in a hospital. But before he could
wonder any more, his breath was quickly taken away by the shout
those little white children gave. “Oh, Oh! M—M—” they cried.
“How pretty!” “How beautiful!” “Oh, isn’t it lovely?” He knew
they must mean him, for all their shining eyes were looking straight
at him. He stood straight as a mast and quivered in every needle for
joy. Presently one weak little voice called out, “It’s the nicest Christmas
tree I ever saw!” And then, at last, the Little Fir Tree knew
what he was; he was a Christmas tree! And from his shiny head to
his feet he was glad, through and through, because he was just little
enough to be the nicest kind of a tree in the world.</p>

<h5>A CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Juliet Wilbur Tompkins</span></p>

<p>The two were amazingly, even absurdly alike, as they faced each
other across the library table. The very scowl that lay heavy on the
girl’s forehead was an obvious inheritance from the parental scowl
opposite.</p>

<p>“I’m a self-made man, Paula—plain Western goods. It’s too late
to teach me fancy values. I don’t go a hang on anything but facts.
Some folks can put a paper frill around a mutton chop and call it
lamb, but that ain’t my way. I see things as they are.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m the daughter of a self-made man, and of a New England
school-teacher too; if you can beat that combination for seeing things,
as they are—”</p>

<p>“It’s your notion that you see this young feller as he is?”</p>

<p>“I do. And he has got just the things that you and I haven’t and
need.”</p>

<p>“He has, eh? You might mention one or two.”</p>

<p>“Ancestry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, a sense of humor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“A—what?” If she had said a “top-knot,” he could not have looked
more amazedly disgusted.</p>

<p>“A sense of humor. And he’s got common sense too. He’s poor
and alone in the world and not awfully practical, but I tell you, father,
there’s stuff in him that we hustlers have got to get into our families
sooner or later, if we’re going to the top. And—I—am.”</p>

<p>“H’m. On sixty dollars a month?”</p>

<p>“If necessary. Oh, I don’t pretend that Ralph has done much in
business yet. Few men have, at nineteen.”</p>

<p>“At nineteen I had been at work seven years, and had been raised
six times, both in salary and position. This young feller tells me he
has been at work three years, and has been raised once—in salary only.”</p>

<p>“And that once was since he became interested in me; there is one
thing you have got to take into account, father—that Ralph with me
will have a very different career from Ralph without me.”</p>

<p>“But, Paula, is that just your notion of a husband?”</p>

<p>“Ralph is just my notion of a husband.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry, but he ain’t mine, and that settles it. You’ll live
to thank me for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s fair warning: I don’t give him up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you will.”</p>

<p>“You are trying to make the worst mistake of your life, father,”
she said reasonably. “Now a mushy daughter would give in and let
you repent it later; but I think it’s a lot better to save you from it,
and <i>you’ll</i> live to thank me yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll live to take you East and leave you there with your Aunt
Jennie, till you’ve got sense, if I hear any more of this.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you won’t hear any more about it.” And she went out.</p>

<p>“The little cuss!” he muttered. Then he sat down and wrote a
letter beginning, “Dear Jennie,” and ending, “For heaven’s sake, wire
that you will take her, or she’ll be off with him—by the front door
and in broad daylight, understand. She’s a straight little cuss. What
an everlasting shame she wasn’t a boy!”</p>

<p>Even as he signed: “Your aff. Bro.,” the massive front door banged;
but he was too absorbed to notice it. Paula, calm and serious, carrying
a suit-case, took a car for the station where a young man was
nervously pacing the platform. He stood watching her for a moment
before she saw him. The clear red of her cheeks was no deeper than
usual, her blue eyes were unclouded, in all her handsome, well-dressed
person there was not one hurried movement. She even paused to
compare her watch with the station clock. An irrepressible laugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
brought the color back to his face. “Oh, Paula, so you are here,” as
he hurried to meet her. “You elope as calmly as you would go
shopping.”</p>

<p>“It’s a far more sensible proceeding! Have you the tickets?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, dear Paula, I want you enough to commit almost any
crime—you know that, and yet I can’t quite square it with myself—this
running away with a man’s daughter. And—such a rich man,
confound it! I’ve been awake all night thinking over one thing. You
swept me off my feet yesterday; but to-day—”</p>

<p>“But, Ralph, I gave father fair warning. And this happens to be a
case where he is wrong and I am right. I don’t think that just because
I’m—I’m fond of you, but I can see, you know, just what you
have got, and what the other men I know haven’t got, better than
father can. He will see it too, some day, and thank me—I told him
so. I’m not really eloping, since eighteen is the age for a girl in this
state. And the fact that you’re not of age yet doesn’t matter, for
you haven’t any parents or guardians to object. And father needn’t
give us any money—we can get along with yours and mine. Now the
train is due in three minutes and, of course, you needn’t marry me
if you don’t want to. But if you do, you’d better get the tickets.”</p>

<p>Three hours later the two emerged from a cab in front of an imposing
courthouse and followed endless lengths of unclean, tessellated
pavement until they reached a door bearing the significant sign:
“Marriage Licenses.” The clerk had the engraved forms out before
anything coherent had been said. He was a hurried, dry little man,
who appeared suffering to say, “Step lively, please!” at every pause.</p>

<p>“Parents or guardian’s consent?”</p>

<p>“I have no parents or guardian.”</p>

<p>“Can’t issue license to you then.”</p>

<p>“What?—why—why not?”</p>

<p>“Law of the state.”</p>

<p>“But I am of age!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can get married all right, but he can’t.”</p>

<p>“But what can we do?”</p>

<p>“Wait two years, or get a guardian and obtain his consent.” And
Cupid turned firmly back to the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>They went out into the corridor and, finding a bench in a windowed
recess, dropped helplessly down on it while Ralph gave voice to his
personal opinion of the state law.</p>

<p>“Swearing isn’t going to help, Ralph,” said Paula decidedly. “Now
we’ve got to consider everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“But the old fool—when I haven’t a soul who could raise the least—”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. Now suppose we take up each possibility in turn. It’s
half-past twelve, and there isn’t a train back till five-twenty, too late
to head off my letter to father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would be too flat!”</p>

<p>“And yet we don’t know a soul in this city, and we can’t stay here
unmarried.”</p>

<p>“I was a beast, an ass, to get you into such a mess. Perhaps some
sort of a minister could marry us without a license. I know they do
in some states.”</p>

<p>“Go ask him.” But he came back dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done; I ought to be hanged!”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we go and get lunch. I want a cup of coffee and
a ham sandwich.”</p>

<p>They found it near by, at a marble counter, and presently took up
their problem with renewed courage.</p>

<p>“Of course, we can’t stay here unmarried. If we don’t find a way
before five-twenty—we must go back—and father will probably take
me East by the next train.”</p>

<p>“And quite right. I wouldn’t let my daughter marry a blithering
idiot who could get her into a scrape like this.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind father’s rage, but I should hate his crowing. I
can’t bear to be beaten like this, but of course, if you don’t try to
think, we might as well go back to the station.”</p>

<p>“But what can thinking do against a set of darn fool state laws?”
he burst out. “If I had only had the sense to set up a guardian—”
He broke off at her gasp of excitement. Her eyes were fixed on space,
big with a growing idea, for a breathless moment; then she turned to
him radiant, both fists clenched on the counter.</p>

<p>“Ralph, I’ll adopt you! Anybody of age can adopt anybody who
isn’t. Then I will give my consent and there we are!”</p>

<p>He stared at her speechlessly; then he hid his face in his hands
and gave way to wild laughter.</p>

<p>“Have you anything against it?”</p>

<p>“No—no! Nothing!”</p>

<p>“Come on, then. We shall have to hurry.”</p>

<p>“The Court,” to whom they were referred for information, proved
to be a huge, middle-aged, kindly person. If marriage was difficult
under the state laws, adoption was comparatively easy.</p>

<p>“Now what is the very shortest time in which it could be done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it need not take much time. A couple of weeks would be
ample.”</p>

<p>Two pairs of dismayed eyes consulted each other.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do it in less?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. If the circumstances were extraordinary—”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do it before five o’clock to-day?”</p>

<p>“To-day?”</p>

<p>“We came down here to be married, but were refused a license because
I am not of age, and hadn’t anybody to give consent. But if
this lady, who is of age, could legally adopt me before the marriage
bureau closed, then, you see, she could give the necessary consent.”</p>

<p>The Court laughed until his whole bulk was a heaving frame of
merriment. But he was absorbed again in an instant, and after a
moment’s deliberation he took down their names and ages and wrote
briefly:</p>

<p>“And you say the child is willing?”</p>

<p>“He seems to be.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Paula Dennison had been formally appointed
guardian of her future lord and master, and had given her written
consent to his marriage. The Court himself conducted them to the
license bureau, explained matters to the dry little clerk, dryer and
more hurried than ever, witnessed the marriage, kissed the bride,
escorted them down-stairs, and put them into a cab.</p>

<p>The Court was still standing to smile after the departing carriage
when another came lurching up from the direction of the station. Even
before it could stop, a middle-aged man had burst out and was striding
up the steps with dark and concerted purpose on his flushed face.
The Court stared at him, at first absently, then with dawning suspicion—chin,
blue eyes, carriage—surely such a resemblance could not be a
mere coincidence! After a brief hesitation he discreetly followed, and
suspicion grew to conviction as the man turned to the marriage license
bureau. The Court, lurking in the shadow of the open door, heard
him demand whether a young woman named Dennison had tried to
get married there to-day.</p>

<p>“Married fifteen minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“But they couldn’t be—the boy wasn’t of age. ’Tain’t legal. You
had no right to issue a license. Why, I’ll have you—”</p>

<p>“The applicant had the written consent of his guardian.”</p>

<p>“But he hadn’t got a guardian—I found that out before I started.
He was fooling you. It’s a—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>Paula’s written consent was laid before his eyes.</p>

<p>“The lady took out papers of guardianship, and so her consent was
valid.”</p>

<p>“Adopted him? Adopted him and then married him! The little
cuss! Adopted him, by golly! Oh, why wasn’t she a boy? Oh, well,
I guess it’s all right. Adopted him! And I never thought of that!”</p>

<h5>THE HONOR OF THE WOODS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anonymous</span></p>

<p>The principal character of this story is John Norton, an aged trapper
and scout in the Adirondacks, who is adored by the people for his
bravery and courage. And although he has not rowed in a race for
over forty years, he has decided to enter a free for all contest, to be
pulled on the Saranac. He does this, because guides have brought him
word that “perfessionals” are to pull. And he thinks it would be
an “eternal shame if them city boasters beat the men born in the woods
and on their own waters too.” Another important character in our
story is a young boy, of whom John Norton always speaks as “the Lad,”
a good-hearted, simple-minded boy, whom the trapper has befriended
and who worships the old man. At the hotel all is expectation. A
great crowd has gathered in anticipation of the morrow’s races, for
the guides had brought word that “Old John Norton was not only
coming, but that he was going to enter the race.” The thought that
they were going to see this celebrated man stirred the people with a
feeling of intense curiosity.</p>

<p>In the crowd were several aged men who remembered the fame the
trapper had as an oarsman fifty years ago. And one of their number
closed a heated verbal debate about the merits of the various contestants
with, “I tell you, sir, there ain’t a man on God’s green earth
kin beat John Norton at the oars.” On the other hand the professionals
had their backers—college boys, English tourists, lawyers, clergymen,
and bankers. Thus stood the feeling when a boat, with the Lad at
the oar and the trapper at the paddle, came out from behind an island
into plain view of the hundreds that were watching for it. As the
boat came on talking ceased, and amid a profound silence it drew up
within fifty feet of the landing. Suddenly an old man leaning on a
stout stick flourished it in the air, and exclaimed in a voice that shook
with the intensity of his emotion, “John Norton, he saved my life at
the battle of Salt Lakes forty years ago. Three cheers for John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Norton!” Then such a cheer arose as to burst the stillness into
fragments and, thrice repeated, rolled its roar across the lake and
against the distant hills, until their hollow caverns resounded again,
while on the instant a hundred white handkerchiefs, waved by whiter
hands, sprang into sight and filled the air with their snowy flutterings.
For one instant the color came and went in the face of the surprised
trapper. He then arose and stood at his utmost height. Meanwhile
the eyes of the great multitude had time to take in his splendid proportions,
and the grave majesty of his countenance. He then settled
back and the boat moved toward the landing. It was high noon on
the Saranac, and a brighter day was never seen. The lake had not
stirred a ripple, and the air was that cool, fragrant air so good to
breathe in a race. The “free for all” was to be pulled at one o’clock.
The entries were closed the evening before, and stood seven in all:
the three professionals, the brother guides, known as Fred and Charley,
the old trapper and the Lad.</p>

<p>The boats were already in position. The course ran straight down
the lake to a line of seven buoys, so that each boat had its own buoy
to turn around and thence pull back again. The length of the course
was just four miles, a longer race by half than was ever before pulled
on those waters. The boats were by no means the same length and
width—the Lad’s was by far the heaviest.</p>

<p>The number of spectators was a wonder to all; where all the people
came from was a mystery. The long piazza of the hotel, the wharf,
even the roof of the boathouse swarmed with human beings. The
shore on either side was lined with spectators for the distance of half
a mile.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said the trapper, “ye must remember that a four-mile
race is a good deal of a pull, and the goin’ off ain’t half so decidin’ as
the comin’ in. I don’t conceit that we can afford to fool any time,
for them perfessionals have come here to row, and they look to me
as if they had a good deal of that sort of stuff in them; but it won’t
do to get flustrated at the start, and if ye see fit to follow I’ll set ye
a jegmatical sort of a stroke that will send us out to the buoys
yonder without any rawness in the windpipe or kinks in the legs. But
still if ye don’t think yer a-pullin’ fast enough take yer lick, fur in such
a race as this is likely to be, a man should follow his own notions and
act accordin’ to his gifts.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we will win, old trapper?” asked Fred. “I dunno, boy,
I sartinly dunno, but I don’t like yer oars, especially that left one.
There’s a kink in the shank of it that hadn’t orter be there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Your oars are big enough to hold anyway and I hold you will win.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, boys, thank ye; yis, I sartinly shall try, for it would be
a mortal shame to have that prize to go out of the woods, an’ if nothin’
gives way I’ll give ’em a touch of the stuff that’s in me, the last mile,
that’ll make ’em get down to work in earnest, but if anything happens
I have great hopes of the Lad there, for his gifts are wonderful at
the oars and—”</p>

<p>“<i>Ready there</i>,” came the clear voice of the starter; “ready there for
the word.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, ready it is,” replied the trapper. “Now, Lad, if anything
happens to me and you see I can’t win, John Norton will never forgive
you if you don’t pull like a sinner runnin’ from jedgment.”</p>

<p>“Ready there, all of you; <i>One</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, GO.”</p>

<p>The oars of the professionals dropped on the water as if their blades
were controlled by one man, and their stroke was so tense and quick
that the light boats fairly jumped ahead. The trapper and the Lad
had been slower to get away and were a full length behind before
they got fairly into motion. The Lad was the last to get started and
so careless and ungainly was his appearance that the crowd, who
cheered at the passage of the others, laughed and groaned at him.
For forty rods the race continued without change in the relative position
of the boats.</p>

<p>The oars flashed, dropped and flashed again, as the professionals
swept their oars ahead. Some rods behind the trapper and Fred were
rowing side by side, stroke for stroke, long, steady and strong.</p>

<p>“Yis, yis, I understand; but don’t ye worry, four miles is four miles.
Still if yer a-gittin’ narvous we’ll lengthen out a little jest to show ’em
we ain’ more’n half asleep.” So saying the old man set his comrades
so long and sharply pulled a stroke that the two boats doubled their
rate of speed and came up even with the boats ahead. “There now, I
guess we’ll ease up a leetle, for the time to really pull ain’t come
yet. I tell you, boy, that rifle is a-goin’ to stay here in the woods.
There’s the Lad back there can beat us both, but he won’t try ’cause
he thinks it would tickle an old man like me to win the prize. Easy,
boy, easy, let ’em git ahead if they want to, the comin’ in is what
decides the race.” Thus the boats rushed on their way, while the
multitude watched with eager eyes the receding racers. The party of
the trapper was in the ascendant, for the spurt he had made revealed
the tremendous power of the man and showed that old age had not
weakened his enormous strength. At last a man who stood on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
edge of the boathouse called out: “They have turned the buoys; the
professionals are ahead.”</p>

<p>“How far behind is John Norton?”</p>

<p>“He and the guides are four rods astern at least.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Lad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s out of the race; he’s fully ten rods behind the trapper and
Fred.” By this time the boats were plainly in view—the contestants
were barely a mile away.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said the trapper, “the time has come for us to show
the stuff that’s in us. Are ye ready for the stroke, boys?” A groan
of pain interrupted the trapper. The oars of Charley were trailing—his
strength had given out and his nose was bleeding profusely.
“Never mind,” whispered the trapper to Fred, “you must win this race
if your whole family dies—all right, long and quick now.” The young
man obeyed. He threw the full force of his strength on the oars. The
sudden vigor was too much for the wood; there was a crash and the
guide was thrown on his side. The trapper was now thoroughly
aroused. The boats were within a hundred yards of the home-line and
the Lad was fully fifteen astern. The roar of the crowd was deafening,
but through it a voice arose: “John Norton, now is your time,
pull.”</p>

<p>The old man gathered himself for a supreme effort, and then occurred
a catastrophe so overwhelming that it hushed the roar of the
crowd. He had torn the rowlocks from the gunnels. For a moment
there was silence; even the professionals intermitted a stroke; but the
Lad turned his face ahead. The old man arose and stood erect in
the boat. He shook the heavy oars in the air as if they had been reeds
and shouted in a voice that sounded awful in its intensity: “Now,
Lad, row for the sake of John Norton, and save his gray hairs from
shame. Pull with every ounce of strength the Almighty has given
you, or the honor of the woods is gone.”</p>

<p>It was worth a thousand miles of travel and a year of life to see
what happened. The Lad suddenly sat erect and his stroke lengthened
to the full reach of oar and arm. His boat seemed to spring into the
air, it flew on the top of the water, and, as it passed the trapper, he
shouted wildly, “Go it, Lad, go it, Lad, the honor of the woods be on
ye! Give it to ’em, give it to ’em, ye’ll beat ’em yit, sure as judgment
day.”</p>

<p>Except his voice, not a sound was heard. Men clutched their fists
till the nails cut the skin of their palms. One of the professionals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
fainted unnoticed, another threw up his oars, crazed by the excitement,
while the third pulled in grim desperation; but he pulled in vain, for
the Lad’s boat caught him within fifty feet of the line and shot across
it half a length to the front. And then there arose such a shout as
had not been heard that day. “Three cheers for the Lad, three cheers
for the Lad,”—and the honor of the woods was saved.</p>

<h5>TRAVERS’ FIRST HUNT</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Richard Harding Davis</span></p>

<p>Young Travers, who had been engaged to a girl down on Long
Island for the last three months, only met her father and brother a few
weeks before the day set for the wedding.</p>

<p>The brother was a master of hounds near South Hampton; the
father and son talked horse all day and until one o’clock in the morning,
for they owned fast thoroughbreds, and entered them at Sheepshead
Bay, and other race tracks.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Paddock, the father of the girl, had often said that when
a young man asked for his daughter’s hand, he would ask him in return,
not if he <i>lived</i> straight, but if he could <i>ride</i> straight; and that
on his answering in the affirmative, depended her parent’s consent.</p>

<p>Travers had met Miss Paddock and her mother in Europe. He was
invited to their place in the fall when the hunting season opened, and
had spent the evening most pleasantly and satisfactorily with his fiancée
in the corner of the drawing-room. But as soon as the women had
gone, young Paddock joined him and said: “You ride, of course?”</p>

<p>Travers had never ridden, but had been prompted what to answer
by Miss Paddock, and so said there was nothing he liked better. As
he expressed it, he would rather ride than sleep.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” said Paddock. “I’ll give you a mount on Satan
to-morrow morning at the meet. He is a bit nasty at the start of
the season, and ever since he killed Wallis, the second groom, last
year, none of us care much to ride him; but you can manage him, no
<i>doubt</i>. He’ll just carry your weight.”</p>

<p>Mr. Travers dreamed that night of taking large, desperate leaps into
space on a wild horse that snorted forth flames, and that rose at solid
stone walls as though they were hay-racks. He was tempted to say
he was ill in the morning, which was, considering the state of his
mind, more or less true, but concluded as he would have to ride<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
sooner or later during his visit, and if he died breaking his neck, it
would be in a good cause, he determined to do his best.</p>

<p>He didn’t want to ride at all for two excellent reasons: First, because
he wanted to live for Miss Paddock’s sake, and second, because
he wanted to live for his own sake.</p>

<p>The next morning was a most forbidding and doleful looking morning,
and young Travers had great hopes that the meet would be declared
off, but just as he lay in doubts the servant knocked at his
door with his riding things and his hot water.</p>

<p>He came down-stairs looking very miserable indeed. Satan had
been taken to the place where they were to meet, and Travers viewed
him on his arrival there with a sickening sense of fear as he saw him
pulling three grooms off their feet.</p>

<p>Travers decided that he would stay with his feet on solid earth just
as long as he could, and when the hounds were thrown off and the rest
had started at a gallop, he waited, under pretense of adjusting his
gaiters, until they were well away. Then he clenched his teeth,
crammed his hat down over his ears, and scrambled up on the saddle.
His feet fell <i>quite</i> by <i>accident</i> into the stirrups, and the next moment
he was off after the others, with an indistinct feeling that he was on
a locomotive that was jumping the ties.</p>

<p>Satan was in among and had passed the other horses in less than
five minutes, and was so near the hounds that the whippers-in gave a
cry of warning. But Travers could just as soon have pulled a boat
back that was going over the Niagara Falls as Satan, and it was only
that the hounds were well ahead that saved them from having Satan
run them down.</p>

<p>Travers had to hold to the saddle with his left hand to keep himself
from falling off, and sawed and sawed on the reins with his right.
He shut his eyes whenever Satan jumped, and never knew how he
happened to stick on; but he did stick on, and was so far ahead that
in the misty morning no one could see how badly he rode. As it was
for daring and speed he led the field, and not even young Paddock
was near him from the start.</p>

<p>There was a broad stream in front of him—and a hill just on the
other side. No one had ever tried to take this at a jump, it was considered
more of a swim than anything else, and the hunters always
crossed it by the bridge on the left. Travers saw the bridge and tried
to jerk Satan’s head in that direction, but Satan kept right on as
straight as an express train over the prairies. Fences and trees and
furrows passed by and under Travers like a panorama run by electricity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
and he only breathed by accident. They went on at the stream
and the hill beyond as though they were riding on a stretch of turf,
and though the whole field sent up a shout of warning and dismay,
Travers could only gasp and shut his eyes. He remembered the fate
of the second groom and shivered.</p>

<p>Then the horse rose like a rocket, lifting Travers so high in the air
that he thought Satan would never come down again, but he did come
down with his feet bunched on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The next instant he was up and over the hill and stopped, panting,
in the center of the pack that was snarling and snapping around the
fox. And then Travers showed that he was a thorough-bred, even
though he could not ride, for he hastily fumbled for his cigar case, and
when the others came pounding up over the hill, they saw him seated
nonchalantly on his saddle, puffing critically at his cigar and giving
Satan patronizing pats on his head.</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” said old Mr. Paddock to his daughter as they rode
back, “if you love that young man and want to keep him, make him
promise to give up riding. A more reckless and more brilliant horseman
I have never seen; he took that double jump at the gate and at
the stream like a centaur, but he will break his neck sooner or later,
and he ought to be stopped.” Young Paddock was so delighted with
his future brother-in-law’s riding that that night in the smoking room
he made him a present of Satan before all the men.</p>

<p>“No,” said Travers gloomily, “I can’t take him; your sister has
asked me to give up what is dearer to me than anything next to herself,
and that is my riding; you see she is absurdly anxious for my
safety, and she has asked me never to ride again, and I have given
my word.”</p>

<p>A chorus of sympathetic remonstrances rose from the men.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Travers, “but it just shows what sacrifices a
man will make for the woman he loves.”</p>

<h5>MARY’S NIGHT RIDE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By George W. Cable</span></p>

<p>Mary Richling, the heroine of this story, was the wife of John
Richling, a resident of New Orleans. At the breaking out of the
Civil War she went to visit her parents in Milwaukee. About the
time of the bombardment of New Orleans, she received news of the
dangerous illness of her husband, and decided at once to reach his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
bedside, if possible. Taking with her her baby daughter, a child of
three years, she proceeded southward, where, after several unsuccessful
attempts to secure a pass, she finally determined to break through
the lines.</p>

<p>About the middle of the night Mary Richling was sitting very still
and upright on a large, dark horse that stood champing his Mexican
bit in the black shadow of a great oak. Mary held by the bridle another
horse, whose naked saddle-tree was empty. A few steps in front
of her the light of the full moon shone almost straight down upon a
narrow road that just there emerged from the shadow of woods on
either side and divided into a main right fork and a much smaller one
that curved around to Mary’s left. Off in the direction of the main
fork the sky was all aglow with camp-fires. Only just here on the left
there was a cool and grateful darkness.</p>

<p>She lifted her head alertly. A twig crackled under a tread, and the
next moment a man came out of the bushes on the left and, without
a word, took the bridle of the led horse from her fingers and vaulted
into the saddle. The hand that rested for a moment on the cantle
grasped a navy-six. He was dressed in dull homespun, but he was
the same who had been dressed in blue. He turned his horse and led
the way down the lesser road.</p>

<p>“If we’d of gone three hundred yards further, we’d a run into the
pickets. I went nigh enough to see the videts settin’ on their horses
in the main road. This here ain’t no road; it just goes up to a nigger
quarters. I’ve got one of the niggers to show us the way.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” whispered Mary, but, before her companion could
answer, a tattered form moved from behind a bush a little in advance
and started ahead in the path, walking and beckoning. Presently they
turned into a clear, open forest and followed the long, rapid, swinging
strides of the negro for nearly an hour. Then they halted on the bank
of a deep, narrow stream. The negro made a motion for them to
keep well to the right when they should enter the water. The white
man softly lifted Alice to his arms, and directed and assisted Mary to
kneel in her saddle with her skirts gathered carefully under her; so
they went down into the cold stream, the negro first with arms outstretched
above the flood, then Mary and then the white man, or let
us say plainly the spy, with the unawakened child on his breast. And
so they rose out of it on the farther side without a shoe or garment
wet, save the rags of their dark guide.</p>

<p>Again they followed him along a line of stake-and-rider fence, with
the woods on one side and the bright moonlight flooding a field of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
young cotton on the other. Now they heard the distant baying of
housedogs, now the doleful call of the chuckwill’s widow, and once
Mary’s blood turned for an instant to ice at the unearthly shriek of
a hoot-owl just above her head. At length they found themselves
in a dim, narrow road, and the negro stopped.</p>

<p>“Dess keep dis yer road fo’ ’bout half mile an’ yo’ strike ’pon de
broad main road. Tek de right, an’ you go whar yo’ fancy take you.
Good-by, Miss. Good-by, Boss; don’t yo’ fergit yo’ promise to tek me
throo to de Yankees when you come back. I feered yo’ gwine fergit

<p>The spy said he would not, and they left him. The half mile was
soon passed, though it turned out to be a mile and a half, and at
length Mary’s companion looked back as they rode single file with
Mary in the rear, and said softly, “There’s the road.”</p>

<p>As they entered it and turned to the right, Mary, with Alice in her
arms, moved somewhat ahead of her companion, her indifferent horsemanship
having compelled him to drop back to avoid a prickly bush.
His horse was just quickening his pace to regain the lost position when
a man sprang up from the ground on the farther side of the highway,
snatched a carbine from the earth and cried, “Halt!”</p>

<p>The dark, recumbent forms of six or eight others could be seen enveloped
in their blankets lying about a few red coals. Mary turned
a frightened look backward and met the eye of her companion.</p>

<p>“Move a little faster,” said he, in a low, clear voice. As he did so,
she heard him answer the challenge, as his horse trotted softly after
hers.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop us, my friend; we’re taking a sick child to the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Halt, you hound!” the cry rang out; and as Mary glanced back
three or four men were just leaping into the road. But she saw also
her companion, his face suffused with an earnestness that was almost
an agony, rise in his stirrups with the stoop of his shoulders all gone,
and wildly cry, “Go!” She smote her horse and flew. Alice woke
and screamed.</p>

<p>The report of a carbine rang out and went rolling away in a thousand
echoes through the wood. Two others followed in sharp succession,
and there went close by Mary’s ear the waspish whine of a minie-ball.
At the same moment she recognized—once, twice, thrice—just at her
back, where the hoofs of her companion’s horse were clattering, the
tart rejoinders of his navy six.</p>

<p>“Go! lay low! lay low! cover the child!” But his words were needless.
With head bowed forward and form crouched over the crying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
clinging child, with slackened rein and fluttering dress, and sunbonnet
and loosened hair blown back upon her shoulders, Mary was riding for
life and liberty and her husband’s bedside.</p>

<p>“Go on! go on! They’re saddling up! Go! Go! We’re going to
make it! Go-oo!” And they made it.</p>

<h5>PEABODY’S LEAP<br>
<span class="smaller">A LEGEND OF LAKE CHAMPLAIN</span></h5>

<p>Many are the places, scattered over the face of our beautiful country,
whose wild and picturesque scenery is worthy of the painter’s
pencil or the poet’s pen. Some of them, which were once celebrated
for their rich stores of “legendary lore,” are now only sought to view
their natural scenery, while the traditions which formerly gave them
celebrity are buried in oblivion. Such is the scene of the following
adventure—a romantic glen, bounded on the north side by a high
and rocky hill which stretches itself some distance into Lake Champlain,
terminating in a precipice, some thirty feet in height, and once known
by the name of “Peabody’s Leap.”</p>

<p>At the time of this adventure, Timothy Peabody was the only white
man that lived within fifty miles of the place, and his was the daring
spirit that achieved it. In an attack on one of the frontier settlements
his family had all been massacred by the merciless savages, and he
had sworn that their death should be avenged. The better to accomplish
this dread purpose, he had removed to this solitary place and
constructed the rude shelter in which he dwelt, till the blasts of winter
drove him to the homes of his fellow-men, again to renew the contest
when spring had awakened nature into life and beauty. He was a
man who possessed much rude cunning, combined with a thorough
knowledge of Indian habits, by which he had always been enabled to
avoid the snares of his subtle enemies. Often when they had come
with a party to take him, he escaped their lures, and after destroying
his hut, on their return homeward some of their boldest warriors were
picked off by his unerring aim—or, on arriving at their settlement,
they learned that one of their swiftest hunters had been ambushed by
him, and fallen a victim of his deadly rifle. He had lived in this way
for several years, and had so often baffled them, that they had at last
become weary of the pursuit, and, for some time, had left him unmolested.</p>

<p>About this time, a party of Indians made a descent on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
small settlements, and had taken three men prisoners, whom they were
carrying home to sacrifice for the same number of their men that
had been shot by Peabody. It was towards the close of day when
they passed his abode; most of the party in advance of the prisoners,
who, with their hands tied, and escorted by five or six Indians, were
almost wearied out by their long march, and but just able to crawl
along. He had observed this advance guard, and let them pass unmolested,
for he suspected there were prisoners in the rear, and intended
to try some “Yankee trick” to effect their rescue. He accordingly
followed on in the trail of the party, keeping among the
thick trees which on either side skirted the path. He had proceeded
but a short distance before he heard the sharp report of a rifle apparently
very near him, and which he knew must be one of the Indians
who had strolled from the main body to procure some game for their
evening meal. From his acquaintance with their habits and language,
he only needed a disguise to enable him to join with the party if
necessary and, aided by the darkness which was fast approaching,
with but little danger of detection. The resolution was quickly formed,
and as quickly put into operation, to kill this Indian and procure his
dress.</p>

<p>He had got but a few paces before he discovered his intended victim,
who had just finished loading his rifle. To stand forth and boldly
confront him would give the savage an equal chance, and if Tim
proved the best shot, the party on hearing the report of two rifles at
once would be alarmed and commence a pursuit. The chance was,
therefore, two to one against him, and he was obliged to contrive a
way to make the Indian fire first. Planting himself, then, behind a
large tree, he took off his fox-skin cap, and placing it on the end of
his rifle, began to move it to and fro. The Indian quickly discovered
it, and was not at a loss to recollect the owner by the cap. Knowing
how often the white warrior had eluded them, he determined to
despatch him at once, and without giving him notice of his dangerous
proximity, he instantly raised his rifle, and its contents went whizzing
through the air. The ball just touched the bark of the tree, and
pierced the cap, which rose suddenly like the death-spring of the
beaver, and then fell amid the bushes. The Indian, like a true sportsman,
thinking himself sure of his victim, did not go to pick up his
game till he had reloaded his piece, and dropping it to the ground, was
calmly proceeding in the operation, when Timothy as calmly stepped
from his hiding-place, exclaiming—“Now, you tarnal kritter, say yer
prayers as fast as ever you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>This was a short notice for the poor Indian. Before him, and
scarcely ten paces distant, stood the tall form of Peabody, motionless
as a statue—his rifle to his shoulder—his finger on the trigger, and his
deadly aim firmly fixed on him. He was about to run, but he had not
time to turn around, ere the swift-winged messenger had taken his
flight; the ball pierced his side—he sprang in the air, and fell lifeless
on the ground.</p>

<p>No time was now to be lost. Peabody immediately proceeded to
strip the dead body and to array himself in the accouterments, consisting
of a hunting shirt, a pair of moccasins, or leggins, and the
wampum belt and knife. A little of the blood besmeared on his
sunburnt countenance served for the red paint, and it would have taken
a keen eye in the gray twilight and thick gloom of the surrounding
forest to have detected the counterfeit Indian. Shouldering his rifle,
he again started in pursuit, and followed the band till they arrived in
the glen, where their canoes were secreted. Here they stopped, and
began to make preparations for their expected supper, previous to their
embarkation for the opposite shore. The canoes were launched and
their baggage deposited in them. A fire was blazing brightly and the
party were walking around, impatiently waiting the return of the
hunter.</p>

<p>The body of Timothy was safely deposited behind a fallen tree, where
he could see every motion, and hear every word spoken in the circle.
Here he had been about half an hour. Night had drawn her sable
curtain around the scene or, in other words, it was dark. The moon
shone fitfully through the clouds which almost covered the horizon,
only serving occasionally to render the darkness visible. The Indians
now began to evince manifest signs of impatience for the return of
their comrade. They feared that a party of the whites had followed
them and taken him prisoner, and at last resolved to go in search
of him. The plan, which was fortunately overheard by Timothy, was
to put the captives into one of the canoes, under the care of five of
their number, who were to secrete themselves in case of an attack,
massacre the prisoners, and then go to the assistance of their brethren.</p>

<p>As soon as the main body had started, Peabody cautiously crept
from his hiding-place to the water and, sliding in feet foremost, moved
along on his back, his face just above the surface, to the canoe which
contained the rifles of the guard. The priming was quickly removed
from these, and their powder-horns emptied, replaced, and the prisoners
given notice of their intended rescue, at the same time warning
them not to show themselves above the gunwale till they were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
safety. He next, with his Indian knife, separated the thong which
held the canoe to the shore, intending to swim off with it till he had
got far enough to avoid observation, then get in, and paddle for the
nearest place where a landing could be effected. All this was but the
work of a moment, and he was slowly moving off from the shore, as
yet unobserved by the guard, who little expected an attack from this
side. But, unfortunately, his rifle had been left behind, and he was
resolved not to part with “Old Plumper,” as he called it, without at
least one effort to recover it. He immediately gave the captives notice
of his intention, and directed them to paddle slowly and silently out,
and in going past the headland, to approach as near as possible, and
there await his coming.</p>

<p>The guard by this time had secreted themselves, and one of the
number had chosen the same place which Timothy himself had previously
occupied, near which he had left his old friend. He had almost
got to the spot, when the Indian discovered the rifle, grasped it, and
springing upon his feet, gave the alarm to his companions. Quick
as thought, Tim was upon him, seized the rifle, and wrenched it from
him with such violence as to throw him breathless to the ground.
The rest of the Indians were alarmed, and, sounding the war-whoop,
rushed upon him.</p>

<p>It was a standard maxim with Timothy, that “a good soldier never
runs till he is obliged to,” and he now found that he should be under
the necessity of suiting his practice to his theory. There was no time
for deliberation; he instantly knocked down the foremost with the
butt of his rifle, and bounded away through the thicket like a startled
deer. The three remaining Indians made for the canoe in which the
rifles were deposited, already rendered harmless by the precaution of
Timothy. This gave him a good advantage, which was not altogether
unnecessary, as he was much encumbered with his wet clothes, and
before he reached the goal he could hear them snapping the dry twigs
close behind him. The main body likewise got the alarm, and were
but a short distance from him when he reached the headland. Those
who were nearest he did not fear, unless they came to close action,
and he resolved to send one more of them to his long home before
he leaped from the precipice.</p>

<p>“It’s a burning shame to wet so much powder,” he exclaimed; “I’ll
have one more pop at the tarnal red-skins.” Tim’s position was quickly
arranged to put his threat in execution. His rifle was presented, his
eye glanced along its barrel, and the first one that showed his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
received its deadly contents. Another, and still another Indian, were
thus disposed of, and then, taking a deep breath, Timothy made the
leap. The water was deep and it seemed a long time before he came
to the surface, but in a moment he struck out for the canoe. The
whole party of Indians by this time had come up, and commenced a
brisk fire upon the fugitives. Tim stood erect in the canoe, shouting
in the voice of a stentor, “Ye’d better take care, ye’ll spile the skiff.
Old Plumper’s safe, and you’ll feel him yet, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>Peabody and the rescued prisoners were quickly lost in darkness,
and, taking a small circuit, effected a landing in safety. Many a man’s
life verified his last threat, and Peabody lived to a good old age,
having often related to his friends and neighbors the adventure which
gave to this place the name of “Peabody’s Leap.”</p>

<h5>DONA MARIA’S DEFIANCE</h5>

<p>[Philip the Second, king of Spain, murdered his own brother, Don
John of Austria. Dona Maria Dolores de Mendoza, betrothed to the
slain man, discovers that her innocent father has taken the blame upon
himself for this atrocious crime in order that his king might not be
branded before the eyes of the world. Thus the beautiful woman
comes before her king with a great purpose: First, to have her
father released from prison; and second, to express her personal
hatred for the murderer of her lover. The king is alone when she
enters.]</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> Be seated, Dona Dolores. I am glad that you have come,
for I have much to say to you and some questions to ask of you. In
my life I have suffered more than most men in being bereaved of the
persons to whom I have been most sincerely attached. One after another
those that I have loved have been taken from me, until I am almost
alone in the world that is so largely mine. My sorrows have
reached their crown and culmination to-day in the death of my dear
brother. I know why you have come to me; you wish to intercede for
your father. It is right that you come to me yourself.</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> I ask justice, not mercy, sire.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> Your father shall have both, for they are compatible.</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> He needs no mercy, for he has done no wrong.
Your majesty knows that as well as I.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> I cannot guess what you know or do not know.</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> I know the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> I wish I did. Tell me; you may be able to help me sift it.
What do you know?</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> I was close behind the door. I heard every word.
I heard your sword drawn and I heard Don John fall, and then it
was some time before I heard my father’s voice taking the blame upon
himself lest it should be said that a king had murdered his own
brother in his room unarmed. Is that the truth, or not? I came in
and found him dead. He was unarmed, murdered without a chance
for his life, and my father took the blame to save you from the
monstrous accusation. Confess that what I say is true. I am a
Spanish woman and would not see my country branded before the
world with the shame of your royal murders; and if you will confess
and save my father I will keep your secret for my country’s sake. If
you will not, by the God that made you I will tell all Spain
what you are, and the men who loved Don John of Austria will
rise and take your blood for his blood, though it be blood royal, and
you shall die as you killed, like the coward you are. You will not?
Then—</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> No, No! Stay here; you must not go. What do you want
me to say?</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> Say, “You have spoken the truth.”</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> Stay—yes—it is true—I did it—for Spain—For God’s
mercy do not betray me.</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> That is not all. That was for me, that I might hear
the words from your own lips.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> What more do you want of me?</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> My father’s freedom and safety. I must have an
order for his instant release. Send for him. Let him come here at
once as a free man.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> That is impossible. He has confessed the deed before the
whole court. He must at least have a trial. You forget to whom you
are speaking.</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> I am not asking anything of your majesty. I am
dictating terms to my lover’s murderer.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> You shall not impose your insolence on me any further. I
shall call help—</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> Call whom you will, you cannot save yourself. In
ten minutes there will be a revolution in the palace, and to-morrow all
Spain will be on fire to avenge your brother. Spain has not forgotten
Don Carlos yet. You tortured him to death. There are those alive
who saw you give Queen Isabel the draught that killed her—with your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
own hand. Are you mad enough to think that no one knows these
things; that your spies who spy on others do not spy on you; that you
alone of all mankind can commit every crime with impunity?</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> Take care, girl! Take care!</p>

<p><i>Dona Dolores.</i> Beware, Don Philip of Austria, King of Spain and
half the world, lest a girl’s voice be heard above yours, and a girl’s
hand loosen the foundations of your throne. Outside this door are
men who guess the truth already; who hate you as they hate Satan;
and who loved your brother as every living being loved him, except
you. One moment more. Order my father to be set free, or I will
open and speak. One moment! You will not? It is too late—you
are lost.... If you ring that bell, I will open the door. Bring the
order here where I am safe. I must read it myself before I am
satisfied. [<i>Philip writes order.</i>] I humbly thank your majesty and
take my leave.—This scene is arranged from the novel “In the Palace
of the King,” by Marion Crawford.</p>

<h5>THE KING AND THE POET</h5>

<p>[François Villon, the poet, fought and severely wounded the traitorous
Grand Constable of France, Thibaut d’Aussigny. King Louis
XI, in a whimsical mood, had the poet elevated to his opponent’s station
instead of having him cast into prison and sentenced to death.
Lady Katherine, hearing that François had fought with Thibaut d’Aussigny,
whom she hates for his many protestations of love, and
knowing that the penalty was death, pleads for the poet’s life at the
feet of him whom she supposes to be the new Grand Constable, but
who after all is none other than her own true lover.]</p>

<p>(<i>The morning after his visit to the Fircone Tavern, Louis sat in his
rose-garden, pondering upon his strange adventure of the night before.
A favorite astrologer had interpreted his dream to mean that one in the
depths, if exalted, would be of great service to him. He knew how
precarious his position was, how unpopular he was with the people, how
strong were the forces of the Duke of Burgundy, how little he could
depend upon the allegiance of the people of Paris if once the enemy
set foot within the capital city. His encounter with Villon coming
upon the heels of his strange dream, and followed by the vague
prophecies of the star-gazer, made him believe that the fantastic
rhymester was sent to him in a time of peril to be of support to his
throne.</i></p>

<p><i>A heavy tread behind him stirred him from his meditations. Turning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
he beheld the companion of his adventure the previous evening.</i>)</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Well, Tristan?</p>

<p><i>Tristan.</i> The bird has flown, sire. Thibaut’s wound was much
slighter than we thought last night. After we carried him to his house,
he made his escape thence in disguise, and has, as I believe, fled from
Paris to join the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> I wish the Duke joy of him. He is more dangerous to my
enemy when he is on my enemy’s side. And my rival for loyalty?</p>

<p><i>Tristan.</i> Barber Oliver has charge of him. I would have hanged
the rogue out of hand.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> The stars warn me that I need this rhyming ragamuffin.</p>

<p><i>Tristan.</i> Are you going to let him think he is king, sire?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Not quite. When he wakes, he is to be assured that he is
the Count of Montcorbier and Grand Constable of France. His antics
may amuse me, his lucky star may serve me, and his winning tongue
may help to avenge me on a certain forward maid, who disdained me.
Send me here Oliver. [<i>Exit Tristan.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Katherine comes slowly down one of the rose-ways.</i>]</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Where are you going, girl?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> To her majesty, sire, who bade me gather roses.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> You are a pretty child. You might have had a king’s love.
Well, well, you were a fool. Does not Thibaut woo you?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> He professes to love me, sire, and I profess to hate him.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> He was sorely wounded last night in a tavern scuffle.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Only wounded, sire?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Your solicitude is adorable. Be of cheer. He may recover.
And we have clapped hands on the assassin. He shall pay the
penalty.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> This man should not die, sire. Thibaut d’Aussigny was
a traitor, a villain—</p>

<p><i>King.</i> If this knave’s life interests you, plead for it to my lord the
Grand Constable.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Thibaut is pitiless.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Thibaut is no longer in office. Try your luck with his successor.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> His name, sire?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> He is the Count of Montcorbier. He is a stranger in our
court, but he has found a lodging in my heart. He came under safe
conduct from the south last night. I believe he will serve me well,
and I am sure he will always be lenient to loveliness. Now go, girl,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
or my wife and your queen will be wanting her roses. [<i>Exit Katherine.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Glancing up the terrace, he perceives the figure of Oliver. Behind
Oliver comes a little cluster of pages, and behind them again the king
can see a shining figure in cloth of gold.</i>]</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Here comes my mountebank as pompous as if he were born
to the purple. It would be rare sport if Mistress Katherine disdained
Louis to decline upon this beggar. He shall hang for mocking me.
But he carries himself like a king for all his tatters and patches, and
he shall taste of splendor.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>As the little procession descends the steps into the rose-garden the
king moves swiftly to the door of the tower and enters. There is a
little grating in the door, and through this grating the king now peers

<p class="hanging">[<i>Master Villon is greatly changed. The barber’s own handiwork has
cleansed and shaved his countenance. He is as sumptuously attired
as if he were a prince of the blood royal. It is plain that the tricked
out poet is in a desperate dilemma. He manages to bear himself with
dignity that consorts with his pomp.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Will your dignity deign to linger awhile in this rose-arbor?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> My dignity will deign to do anything you suggest.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> May we take our leave, monseigneur?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> You may, you may—stay one moment. You know this
plaguy memory of mine—what a forgetful fellow I am. Would you
mind telling me again who I happen to be?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> You are the Count of Montcorbier, monseigneur. You have
just arrived in Paris from the court of Provence, where you stood in
high favor with the king of that country, but your favor is, I believe,
greater with the king of France, for he has been pleased to make you
Grand Constable of France. It is his majesty’s wish that you contrive
to remember this.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Of course, it was most foolish of me to forget. Now, I
suppose, good master long-toes, that a person in my exalted rank has
a good deal of power, influence, authority, and what not?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> With the king’s favor, you are the first man in the
realm.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Quite so! Good sir, will you straightway dispatch some
one you can trust with a handful of these broad pieces to the mother
of Villon, a poor old woman sorely plagued with a scapegrace son?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Let him seek her out and give her these coins that she may buy herself
food, clothes and fire.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> It shall be done. [<i>Exit all but François.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>As soon as Villon finds himself alone he looks cautiously around him
and tries to recall the events of the evening before, which for some
fantastic reason seems to lie centuries behind him.</i>]</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Last night I was a red-handed outlaw, sleeping on the
straw of a dungeon. To-day I wake in a royal bed and my varlets
call me <i>Monseigneur</i>. Either I am mad or I am dreaming. I do not
think I am mad, for I know in my heart that I am poor François
Villon, penniless Master of Arts, and no will-o’-the-wisp Grand Constable.
Then I am dreaming, and everything has been and is a dream.
Then the king—popping up at the last moment, like a Jack-in-the-box—a
dream. These clothes, these servants, this garden—dreams,
dreams, dreams. I shall wake presently and be devilish cold, hungry
and shabby.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>He goes to the golden flagon on the table, pours out a full cup of

<p class="hanging">[<i>Oliver enters the palace, and Katherine approaches Villon.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> My lord, will you listen to a distressed lady?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> She does not know me.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> There is a man in prison at this hour for whom I would
implore your clemency. His name is François Villon. Last night he
wounded Thibaut d’Aussigny. The penalty is death. But Thibaut
was a traitor, sold to Burgundy.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Did this Villon fight him for his treason?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> No! He fought for the sake of a woman.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> How do you know all this?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Because I was the woman. This man had seen me,
thought he loved me, sent me verses—.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> How insolent!</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> It was insolence—and yet they were beautiful verses.
I was in mortal fear of Thibaut. I went to this Villon and begged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
him to kill my enemy. He backed his love-tale with his sword—and
he lies in the shadow of death. It is not just that he should suffer
for my sin.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Do you by any chance love this Villon?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Great ladies do not love tavern bravos. But I pity him
and I do not want him to die.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> If I had stood in this rascal’s shoes, I would have done
as he did for your sake.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> If you think this, you should grant the poor knave his
freedom.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> That brother of ballads shall go free. We will do no
more than banish him from Paris. Forget that such a slave ever
came near you.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> I shall remember your clemency.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> By Saint Venus, I envy this fellow that he should have
won your thoughts. I, too, would die to serve you!</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> My lord, you do not know me.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Did he know you? Yet when he saw you he loved you
and made bold to tell you so.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> His words were of no more account than the wind in
the leaves. But you and I are peers and the words we change have
meanings.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Would you pity me if I told you I love you?</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> Heaven’s mercy, how fast your fancy gallops. I care
little to be flattered and less to be wooed, and I swear that I should
be very hard to win.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> I have more to try than your tap-room bandit. I see
what he saw; I love what he loved.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> You are very inflammable.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> My fire burns to ashes. You can no more stay me from
loving you than you can stay the flowers from loving the soft air,
or true men from loving honor, or heroes from loving glory. I would
rake the moon from heaven for you.</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> That promise has grown rusty since Adam first
made it to Eve. There is a rhyme in my mind about moons and
lovers:</p>

<p><i>Katherine.</i> A trifle. Save France! Oh, that a man would come

<p><i>King.</i> Good afternoon, Lord Constable. Does power taste well?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Nobly, sire! On my knees let me thank your majesty.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Nonsense, man; I’m pleasing myself. You sang yourself into
splendor. “<i>If François were the king of France</i>,” eh?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Sire, I will serve you as never king was served.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> I will make you Grand Constable for a week.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> A week, sire? A week—</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Even so. One wonderful week, seven delirious days. The
world was made in seven days. Seven days of power, seven days of
splendor, seven days of love.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> And then go back to the garret and the kennel, the tavern
and the brothel!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> No, no, not exactly! You don’t taste the full force of the
joke yet. Your last task as Grand Constable will be to hang François
Villon.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Sire, sire, have pity!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> You may have your week of wonder if you wish, but if you
do, by my word as king, you shall swing for it.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Sire, what have I done that you should torture me thus?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> You have mocked a king and maimed a minister. You can’t
get off scot free.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Heaven help me! Life, squalid, sordid, but still life,
with its tavern corners and its brute pleasures of food and drink and
warm sleep, living hands to hold, and living laughter to gladden me—or
a week of cloth of gold, of glory, of love—and then a shameful
death!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> One further chance, fellow. If the Count Montcorbier win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the heart of Lady Katherine within the week, he shall escape the
gallows and carry his lady love where he please.</p>

<p><i>François.</i> On your word of honor, sire?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> My word is my honor, Master François. Well?</p>

<p><i>François.</i> Give me my week of wonders though I die a dog’s death
at the end of it. I will show France and her what lay in the heart
of a poor rhymester.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Spoken like a man! But remember, a bargain’s a bargain.
If you fail to win the lady you must keep yourself for the gallows.
I give you the moon, but I want my price for it.</p>

<h5>THE BISHOP AND THE CONVICT</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Victor Hugo</span></p>

<p>That evening, after his walk in the town, the Bishop of D— remained
quite late in his room. At eight o’clock he was still at work,
writing with some inconvenience on little slips of paper, with a large
book open on his knees, when Mme. Magloire, as usual, came in to
take the silver from the panel by the bed. A moment after, the bishop,
knowing that the table was laid, and that his sister was perhaps waiting,
closed his book and went into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Just as the bishop entered Mme. Magloire was speaking with some
warmth. It was a discussion on the means of fastening the front
door.</p>

<p>It seems that while Mme. Magloire was out making provisions for
supper she had heard the news in sundry places. There was talk that
an ill-favored runaway, a suspicious vagabond, had arrived and was
lurking somewhere near the town, and that it was the part of wise
people to secure their doors thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Brother, do you hear what Mme. Magloire says?”</p>

<p>“I heard something of it indistinctly,” said the bishop. Then, turning
his chair half round, putting his hands on his knees, and raising toward
the old servant his cordial and good-humored face, which the firelight
shone upon, he said: “Well, well, what is the matter! Are we in
any great danger?”</p>

<p>Then Mme. Magloire began her story again, unconsciously exaggerating
it a little. It appeared that a barefooted gypsy man, a sort of
dangerous beggar, was in the town. A man with a knapsack and a
rope and a terrible-looking face.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the bishop.</p>

<p>“We say that this house is not safe at all; and, if monseigneur will
permit me, I will go out and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to
come and put the old bolts in the door again; they are there, and it
will take but a minute. I say we must have bolts, were it only for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to-night; for I say that a door that opens with a latch on the outside
to the first comer, nothing could be more horrible; and then monseigneur
has the habit of always saying: ‘Come in’ even at midnight.
But, my goodness, there is no need to even ask leave—”</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>It opened quickly, quite wide, as if pushed by some one boldly and
with energy.</p>

<p>A man entered.</p>

<p>He came in, took one step, and paused, leaving the door open behind
him. He had his knapsack on his back, his stick in his hand, and a
rough, hard, tired, and fierce look in his eyes, as seen by the firelight.
He was hideous. It was an apparition of ill omen.</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire had not even the strength to scream. She stood,
trembling, with her mouth open.</p>

<p>Mdlle. Baptistine turned, saw the man enter, and started out half
alarmed; then, slowly turning back again toward the fire, she looked
at her brother, and her face resumed its usual calmness and serenity.</p>

<p>“See here! My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict; I have been
nineteen years in the galleys. Four days ago I was set free, and
started for Pontarlier, which is my destination; during these four
days I have walked from Toulon. To-day I have walked twelve
leagues. When I reached this place this evening I went to an inn,
and they sent me away on account of my yellow passport, which I had
shown at the mayor’s office, as was necessary. I went to another inn;
they said: ‘Get out!’ It was the same with one as with another;
no one would have me. I went to the prison and the turnkey would
not let me in. I crept into a dog-kennel, the dog bit me, and drove
me away as if he had been a man; you would have said that he knew
who I was. I went into the fields to sleep beneath the stars; there
were no stars. I thought it would rain, and there was no good God
to stop the drops, so I came back to the town to get the shelter of
some doorway. There in the square I lay down upon a stone; a
good woman showed me your house, and said: ‘Knock there!’ I
have knocked. What is this place? Are you an inn? I have money;
my savings, one hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous, which I
have earned in the galleys by my work for nineteen years. I will pay.
What do I care? I have money. I am very tired—twelve leagues on
foot—and I am so hungry. Can I stay?”</p>

<p>“Mme. Magloire,” said the bishop, “put on another plate.”</p>

<p>The man took three steps and came near the lamp which stood on
the table. “Stop,” he exclaimed, as if he had not been understood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
“not that, did you understand me? I am a galley slave—a convict—I
am just from the galleys.” He drew from his pocket a large sheet
of yellow paper, which he unfolded. “There is my passport, yellow,
as you see. That is enough to have me kicked out wherever I go.
Will you read it? I know how to read, I do. I learned in the galleys.
There is a school there for those who care for it. See, see, here
is what they have put in my passport: ‘Jean Valjean, a liberated convict,
has been nineteen years in the galleys; five years for burglary;
fourteen years for having attempted four times to escape. This man
is very dangerous.’ There you have it! Everybody has thrust me
out; will you receive me? Is this an inn? Can you give me something
to eat and a place to sleep? Have you a stable?”</p>

<p>“Mme. Magloire,” said the bishop, “put some sheets on the bed in
the alcove.”</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire went out to fulfill her orders.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, sit down and warm yourself; we are going to take supper
presently, and your bed will be made ready while you sup.”</p>

<p>“True? What? You will keep me? You won’t drive me away—a
convict? You call me monsieur and don’t say, ‘Get out, dog!’ as
every one else does. I thought that you would send me away, so I
told first off who I am. I shall have a supper? A bed like other
people? With mattress and sheets—a bed? It is nineteen years that
I have not slept on a bed. M. Innkeeper, what is your name? I will
pay all you say. You are an innkeeper, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am a priest who lives here.”</p>

<p>“A priest, oh, noble priest! Then you do not ask any money?”</p>

<p>“No, keep your money. How much have you?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous.”</p>

<p>“And how long did it take you to earn that?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen years.”</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire brought in a plate and set it on the table.</p>

<p>“Mme. Magloire, put this plate as near the fire as you can. The
night wind is raw in the Alps; you must be cold, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Every time he said the word monsieur with his gently solemn and
heartily hospitable voice the man’s countenance lighted up. Monsieur
to a convict is a glass of water to a man dying of thirst at sea.</p>

<p>“The lamp gives a very poor light.”</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire understood him, and going to his bed-chamber, took
from the mantel the two silver candlesticks, lighted the candles and
placed them on the table.</p>

<p>“M. l’Curé, you are good; you don’t despise me. You take me into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
your house; you light your candles for me, and I haven’t hid from
you where I came from, and how miserable I am.”</p>

<p>“You need not tell me who you are. This is not my house; it is
the house of Christ. It does not ask any comer whether he has a
name, but whether he has an affliction. You are suffering; you are
hungry and thirsty; be welcome. And do not thank me; do not tell
me that I take you into my house. This is the home of no man except
him who needs an asylum. I tell you, who are a traveler, that you
are more at home here than I; whatever is here is yours. What need
have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me, I knew it.”</p>

<p>“Really? You knew my name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your name is my brother. You have seen much suffering.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the red blouse, the ball and chain, the plank to sleep on, the
heat, the cold, the galley’s screw, the lash, the double chain for nothing,
the dungeon for a word—even when sick in bed, the chain. The dogs,
the dogs are happier! nineteen years! and I am forty-six, and now
a yellow passport. That is all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have left a place of suffering. But listen, there will be
more joy in heaven over the tears of a repentant sinner than over the
white robes of a hundred good men. If you are leaving that sorrowful
place with hate and anger against men, you are worthy of compassion;
if you leave it with good will, gentleness and peace, you are
better than any of us.”</p>

<p>Meantime Mme. Magloire had served up supper. The bishop said
the blessing and then served. The man paid no attention to any one.
He ate with the voracity of a starving man.</p>

<p>After having said goodnight to his sister, the bishop took one of
the silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his guest,
and said to him: “Monsieur, I will show you to your room.”</p>

<p>The man followed him.</p>

<p>The house was so arranged that one could reach the alcove in the
oratory only by passing through the bishop’s sleeping-chamber. Just
as they were passing through this room Mme. Magloire was putting up
the silver in the cupboard at the head of the bed. It was the last
thing she did every night before going to bed.</p>

<p>The bishop left his guest wishing him a good night’s rest.</p>

<p>As the cathedral clock struck two, Jean Valjean awoke. He opened
his eyes and looked for a moment into the obscurity about him, then
he closed them to go to sleep again. But he could not get to sleep
again, so he began to think. He remembered noticing the six silver
plates and the large ladle that Mme. Magloire had put on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Those six silver plates took possession of him. There they were
within a few steps. At the very moment that he passed through the
middle room to reach the one he was now in, the old servant was
placing them in a little cupboard at the head of the bed. He had
marked that cupboard well; on the right coming from the dining-room.
They were solid and old silver. With the big ladle they would bring
at least two hundred francs; double what he had got for nineteen
years’ labor.</p>

<p>His mind wavered a whole hour and a long one, in fluctuation and
in struggle. The clock struck three. He opened his eyes, rose up
hastily in bed, reached out his arm and felt his knapsack, which he had
put into the corner of the alcove, then he thrust out his legs and put
his feet on the floor and found himself, he knew not how, seated on
his bed. All at once he stooped down, took off his shoes and put them
softly upon the mat in front of the bed, then he resumed his thinking
posture and was still again. Then he rose to his feet, hesitated for a
moment longer and listened; all was still in the house; he walked
straight and cautiously toward the window which he could discern.
The night was very dark, there was a full moon. On reaching the
window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no bars, opened into the
garden, and was fastened with only a little wedge. He took his club
in his right hand, and, holding his breath, with stealthy steps he moved
toward the door of the next room, which was the bishop’s, as we
know. On reaching the door he found it unlatched. The bishop had
not closed it.</p>

<p>Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound.</p>

<p>He pushed the door. A rusty hinge suddenly sent out into the
darkness a harsh and prolonged creak.</p>

<p>Jean Valjean shivered. He took one step and was in the room.
At the moment when he passed the bed, a cloud broke, as if purposely,
and a ray of moonlight crossing the high window, suddenly lighted
up the bishop’s pale face. He slept tranquilly. His entire countenance
was lit up with a vague expression of content, hope and happiness. It
was more than a smile and almost a radiance.</p>

<p>Jean Valjean was in the shadow with the iron drill in his hand,
erect, motionless, terrified at this radiant figure. He had never seen
anything comparable to it. This confidence filled him with fear. He
did not remove his eyes from the old man. He appeared ready either
to cleave his skull or to kiss his hand.</p>

<p>In a few moments he raised his left hand slowly to his forehead
and took off his hat; then letting his hand fall with the same slowness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Jean Valjean resumed his contemplations, his cap in his left hand, his
club in his right, and his hair bristling on his fierce-looking head.</p>

<p>Under this frightful gaze the bishop still slept in profoundest peace.</p>

<p>The crucifix above the mantel-piece was dimly visible in the moonlight,
apparently extending its arms toward both, with a benediction
for one and a pardon for the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jean Valjean put on his cap, then passed quickly, without
looking at the bishop, along the bed, straight to the cupboard which
he perceived near its head; he raised the drill to force the lock;
the key was in it; he opened it; the first thing he saw was the basket
of silver; he took it, crossed the room with hasty stride, careless of
noise, reached the door, entered the oratory, took his stick, stepped
out, put the silver in his knapsack, threw away the basket, ran across
the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger and fled.</p>

<p>The next day at sunrise the bishop was walking in the garden. Mme.
Magloire ran toward him quite beside herself.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, the man has gone! The silver is stolen. The abominable
fellow! He has stolen our silver!”</p>

<p>The bishop was silent for a moment then, raising his serious eyes,
he said mildly to Mme. Magloire: “Now, first, did this silver belong
to us? Mme. Magloire, I have for a long time withheld this silver;
it belonged to the poor. Who was this man? A poor man evidently.”</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!” returned Mme. Magloire. “It is not on my account
or mademoiselle’s; it is all the same to us. But it is on yours, monseigneur.
What is monsieur going to eat from now?”</p>

<p>The bishop looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>“How so! have we no tin plates?”</p>

<p>Just as the brother and sister were rising from their breakfast there
was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the bishop.</p>

<p>The door opened. A strange, fierce group appeared on the threshold.
Three men were holding a fourth by the collar. The three men were
gendarmes; the fourth, Jean Valjean.</p>

<p>In the meantime the bishop had approached as quickly as his great
age permitted. “Ah, there you are!” said he, looking toward Jean
Valjean. “I am glad to see you. But I gave you the candlesticks also,
which are silver like the rest, and would bring two hundred francs.
Why did you not take them along with your plates?”</p>

<p>Jean Valjean opened his eyes and looked at the bishop with an expression
no human tongue could describe.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” said the brigadier, “then what this man said was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
true? We met him. He was going like a man who was running away
and we arrested him in order to see. He had this silver.”</p>

<p>“And he told you that it had been given him by a good old priest
with whom he had passed the night. I see it all. And you brought
him back here? It is all a mistake.”</p>

<p>“If that is so,” said the brigadier, “we can let him go.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the bishop, “you may retire.”</p>

<p>The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who shrank back.</p>

<p>“My friend, before you go away here are the candlesticks; take
them.”</p>

<p>Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks
mechanically and with a wild appearance.</p>

<p>“Now go in peace. By the way, my friend, when you come again
you need not come through the garden. You can always come in and
go out by the front door. It is closed only with a latch, day or night.
Forget not, never forget that you have promised me to use this silver
to become an honest man.</p>

<p>“Jean Valjean, my brother, you belong no longer to evil, but to good.
It is your soul that I am buying for you. I withdraw it from dark
thoughts and from the spirit of perdition and I give it to God!”—Arranged
from “Les Miserables.”</p>

<h5>A DESERT TRAGEDY</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Frank Norris</span></p>

<p>One day, a fortnight after McTeague’s flight from San Francisco,
Marcus rode into Modoc, to find a group of men gathered about a
notice affixed to the outside of the Wells-Fargo office. It was an offer
of reward for the arrest and apprehension of a murderer. The crime
had been committed in San Francisco, but the man wanted had been
traced as far as the western portion of Inyo County, and was believed
at that time to be in hiding in either the Pinto or Panamint hills in
the vicinity of Keeler.</p>

<p>Marcus reached Keeler on the afternoon of that same day. Half
a mile from the town his pony fell and died from exhaustion. Marcus
did not stop even to remove the saddle. He arrived in the barroom
of the hotel in Keeler just after the posse had been made up.
The sheriff, who had come down from Independence that morning,
at first refused his offer of assistance. He had enough men already—too
many, in fact. The country traveled through would be hard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
and it would be difficult to find water for so many men and horses.</p>

<p>“But none of you fellers have ever seen um,” vociferated Marcus,
quivering with excitement and wrath. “I know um well. I could
pick um out in a million. I can identify um, and you fellers can’t.
And I knew—I knew—good God! I knew that girl—his wife—in
Frisco. She’s a cousin of mine, she is—she was—I thought once of—.
This thing’s a personal matter of mine—an’ that money he got away
with, that five thousand, belongs to me by rights. Oh, never mind,
I’m going along. Do you hear?” he shouted, his fists raised, “I’m
going along, I tell you. There ain’t a man of you big enough to stop
me. Let’s see you try and stop me going. Let’s see you once, any
two of you.” He filled the barroom with his clamor.</p>

<p>“Lord love you, come along, then,” said the sheriff.</p>

<p>The posse rode out of Keeler that same night. The keeper of the
general merchandise store, from whom Marcus had borrowed a second
pony, had informed them that Cribbens and his partner, whose description
tallied exactly with that given in the notice of reward, had
outfitted at his place with a view to prospecting in the Panamint hills.
The posse trailed them at once to their first camp at the head of the
valley. It was an easy matter. It was only necessary to inquire of
the cowboys and range-riders of the valley if they had seen and noted
the passage of two men, one of whom carried a bird-cage.</p>

<p>Beyond this first camp the trail was lost, and a week was wasted
in a bootless search around the mine at Gold Gulch, whither it seemed
probable the partners had gone. Then a traveling peddler, who included
Gold Gulch in his route, brought in the news of a wonderful
strike of gold-bearing quartz some ten miles to the south on the western
slope of the range. Two men from Keeler had made a strike,
the peddler had said, and added the curious detail that one of the men
had a canary bird in a cage with him.</p>

<p>The posse made Cribbens’ camp three days after the unaccountable
disappearance of his partner. Their man was gone, but the narrow
hoof-prints of a mule, mixed with those of huge hob-nailed boots,
could be plainly followed in the sand. Here they picked up the trail
and held to it steadily till the point was reached where, instead of
tending southward, it swerved abruptly to the east. The men could
hardly believe their eyes.</p>

<p>“It ain’t reason,” exclaimed the sheriff. “What in thunder is he up
to? This beats me! Cutting out into Death Valley at this time of
year!”</p>

<p>“He’s heading for Gold Mountain over in the Armagosa, sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>The men decided that this conjecture was true. It was the only
inhabited locality in that direction. A discussion began as to the
further movements of the posse.</p>

<p>“I don’t figure on going into that alkali sink with no eight men and
horses,” declared the sheriff. “One man can’t carry enough water to
take him and his mount across, let alone eight. No, sir. Four couldn’t
do it. No, three couldn’t. We’ve got to make a circuit round the
valley and come up on the other side and head him off at Gold
Mountain. That’s what we got to do, and ride like blazes to do it, too.”</p>

<p>But Marcus protested with all the strength of his lungs against
abandoning the trail now that they had found it. He argued that they
were now but a day and a half behind their man. There was no
possibility of their missing the trail—as distinct in the white alkali
as in snow. They could make a dash into the valley, secure their
man, and return long before their water failed them. He, for one,
would not give up the pursuit, now that they were so close. In the
haste of the departure from Keeler the sheriff had neglected to swear
him in. He was under no orders. He would do as he pleased.</p>

<p>“Go on, then, you darn fool,” answered the sheriff. “We’ll cut on
round the valley, for all that. It’s a gamble he’ll be at Gold Mountain
before you’re half-way across. But if you catch him, here”—he tossed
Marcus a pair of handcuffs—“put ’em on him and bring him back to
Keeler.”</p>

<p>Two days after he had left the posse, and when he was already far
out in the desert, Marcus’s horse gave out. In the fury of his impatience
he had spurred mercilessly forward on the trail, and on the
morning of the third day found that his horse was unable to move.
The joints of his legs seemed locked rigidly. He would go his own
length, stumbling and interfering, then collapse helplessly upon the
ground with a pitiful groan. He was used up.</p>

<p>Marcus believed himself to be close upon McTeague now. The
ashes at his last camp had still been smoldering. Marcus took what
supplies of food and water he could carry, and hurried on. But McTeague
was farther ahead than he had guessed, and by evening of his
third day upon the desert Marcus, raging with thirst, had drunk his
last mouthful of water and had flung away the empty canteen.</p>

<p>“If he ain’t got water with um,” he said to himself, as he pushed on,
“if he ain’t got water with um, I’ll be in a bad way. I will, for a
fact.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Marcus’s shout McTeague looked up and around him. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
instant he saw no one. The white glare of alkali was still unbroken.
Then his swiftly rolling eyes lighted upon a head and shoulder that
protruded above the low crest of the break directly in front of him.
A man was there, lying at full length upon the ground, covering him
with a revolver. For a few seconds McTeague looked at the man
stupidly, bewildered, confused, as yet without definite thought. Then
he noticed that the man was singularly like Marcus Schouler. It was
Marcus Schouler. How in the world did Marcus Schouler happen to
be in that desert? What did he mean by pointing a pistol at him
that way? He’d best look out or the pistol would go off. Then his
thoughts readjusted themselves with a swiftness born of a vivid sense
of danger. Here was the enemy at last, the tracker he had felt upon
his footsteps. Now at length he had “come on” and shown himself,
after all those days of skulking. McTeague was glad of it. He’d
show him now. They two would have it out right then and there.
His rifle! He had thrown it away long since. He was helpless.
Marcus had ordered him to put up his hands. If he did not, Marcus
would kill him. He had the drop on him. McTeague stared, scowling
fiercely at the leveled pistol. He did not move.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” shouted Marcus a second time. “I’ll give you three
to do it in. One, two—” Instinctively McTeague put his hands above
his head.</p>

<p>Marcus rose and came towards him over the break.</p>

<p>“Keep ’em up,” he cried. “If you move ’em once I’ll kill you,
sure.”</p>

<p>He came up to McTeague and searched him, going through his
pockets; but McTeague had no revolver; not even a hunting knife.</p>

<p>“What did you do with that money, with that five thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“It’s on the mule,” answered McTeague, sullenly.</p>

<p>Marcus grunted, and cast a glance at the mule, who was standing
some distance away, snorting nervously, and from time to time flattening
his long ears.</p>

<p>“Is that it there on the horn of the saddle, there in that canvas
sack?” Marcus demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it.”</p>

<p>A gleam of satisfaction came into Marcus’s eyes, and under his
breath he muttered: “Got it at last.”</p>

<p>He was singularly puzzled to know what next to do. He had got
McTeague. There he stood at length, with his big hands over his
head, scowling at him sullenly. Marcus had caught his enemy, had
run down the man for whom every officer in the state had been looking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
What should he do with him now? He couldn’t keep him standing
there forever with his hands over his head.</p>

<p>“Got any water?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“There’s a canteen of water on the mule.”</p>

<p>Marcus moved toward the mule and made as if to reach the bridle-rein.
The mule squealed, threw up his head, and galloped to a little
distance, rolling his eyes and flattening his ears.</p>

<p>Marcus swore wrathfully.</p>

<p>“He acted that way once before,” explained McTeague, his hands
still in the air. “He ate some loco-weed back in the hills before I
started.”</p>

<p>For a moment Marcus hesitated. While he was catching the mule
McTeague might get away. But where to, in heaven’s name? A rat
could not hide on the surface of that glistening alkali, and besides,
all McTeague’s store of provisions and his priceless supply of water
were on the mule. Marcus ran after the mule, revolver in hand,
shouting and cursing. But the mule would not be caught. He acted as
if possessed, squealing, lashing out, and galloping in wide circles, his
head high in the air.</p>

<p>“Come on,” shouted Marcus, furious, turning back to McTeague.
“Come on, help me catch him. We got to catch him. All the water
we got is on the saddle.”</p>

<p>McTeague came up.</p>

<p>“He’s eatun some loco-weed,” he repeated. “He went kinda crazy
before.”</p>

<p>“If he should take it into his head to bolt and keep on running—”</p>

<p>Marcus did not finish. A sudden great fear seemed to widen around
and inclose the two men. Once their water gone, the end would not
be long.</p>

<p>“We can catch him all right,” said the dentist. “I caught him once
before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can catch him,” answered Marcus, reassuringly.</p>

<p>Already the sense of enmity between the two had weakened in the
face of a common peril. Marcus let down the hammer of his revolver
and slid it back into the holster.</p>

<p>The mule was trotting on ahead, snorting and throwing up great
clouds of alkali dust. At every step the canvas sack jingled, and
McTeague’s bird-cage, still wrapped in the flour bags, bumped against
the saddle-pads. By and by the mule stopped, blowing out his nostrils
excitedly.</p>

<p>“He’s clean crazy,” fumed Marcus, panting and swearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“We ought to come up on him quiet,” observed McTeague.</p>

<p>“I’ll try and sneak up,” said Marcus; “two of us would scare him
again. You stay here.”</p>

<p>Marcus went forward a step at a time. He was almost within arm’s
length of the bridle when the mule shied from him abruptly and
galloped away.</p>

<p>Marcus danced with rage, shaking his fists, and swearing horribly.
Some hundred yards away the mule paused and began blowing and
snuffing in the alkali as though in search of food. Then, for no
reason, he shied again, and started off on a jog trot toward the east.</p>

<p>“We’ve <i>got</i> to follow him,” exclaimed Marcus, as McTeague came
up. “There’s no water within seventy miles of here.”</p>

<p>Then began an interminable pursuit. Mile after mile, under the
terrible heat of the desert sun, the two men followed the mule, racked
with a thirst that grew fiercer every hour. A dozen times they could
almost touch the canteen of water, and as often the distraught animal
shied away and fled before them. At length Marcus cried:</p>

<p>“It’s no use, we can’t catch him, and we’re killing ourselves with
thirst. We got to take our chances.” He drew his revolver from its
holster, cocked it, and crept forward.</p>

<p>“Steady now,” said McTeague; “it won’t do to shoot through the
canteen.”</p>

<p>Within twenty yards Marcus paused, made a rest of his left forearm
and fired.</p>

<p>“You got him,” cried McTeague. “No, he’s up again. Shoot him
again. He’s going to bolt.”</p>

<p>Marcus ran on, firing as he went. The mule, one foreleg trailing,
scrambled along, squealing and snorting. Marcus fired his last shot.
The mule pitched forward upon his head, then, rolling sideways, fell
upon the canteen, bursting it open and spilling its entire contents into
the sand.</p>

<p>Marcus and McTeague ran up, and Marcus snatched the battered
canteen from under the reeking, bloody hide. There was no water
left. Marcus flung the canteen from him and stood up, facing McTeague.
There was a pause.</p>

<p>“We’re dead men,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>McTeague looked from him out over the desert. Chaotic desolation
stretched from them on either hand, flaming and glaring with the
afternoon heat. There was the brazen sky and the leagues upon
leagues of alkali, leper white. There was nothing more. They were
in the heart of Death Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Not a drop of water,” muttered McTeague; “not a drop of water.”</p>

<p>“We can drink the mule’s blood,” said Marcus. “It’s been done
before. But—but—” he looked down at the quivering, gory body
“—but I ain’t thirsty enough for that yet.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the nearest water?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about a hundred miles or more back of us in the Panamint
hills,” returned Marcus, doggedly. “We’d be crazy long before
we reached it. I tell you we’re <i>done</i> for. We ain’t ever going to get
outa here.”</p>

<p>“Done for?” murmured the other, looking about stupidly. “Done
for, that’s the word. Done for? Yes, I guess we’re done for.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do <i>now</i>?” exclaimed Marcus, sharply, after
a while.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be moving along—somewhere.”</p>

<p>“<i>Where</i>, I’d like to know? What’s the good of moving on?”</p>

<p>“Wat’s the good of stopping here?”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Lord, it’s hot,” said the dentist, finally, wiping his forehead with
the back of his hand. Marcus ground his teeth.</p>

<p>“Done for,” he muttered; “done for.”</p>

<p>“I never was so thirsty,” continued McTeague. “I’m that dry I
can hear my tongue rubbing against the roof of my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t stop here,” said Marcus, finally; “we got to
go somewhere. We’ll try and get back, but it ain’t no manner
of use. Anything we want to take along with us from the mule?
We can—”</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused. In an instant the eyes of the two doomed men
had met as the same thought simultaneously rose in their minds. The
canvas sack with its five thousand dollars was still tied to the horn
of the saddle.</p>

<p>Marcus had emptied his revolver at the mule, and though he still
wore his cartridge belt, he was for the moment as unarmed as McTeague.</p>

<p>“I guess,” began McTeague, coming forward a step, “I guess even
if we are done for, I’ll take—some of my truck along.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” exclaimed Marcus, with rising aggressiveness. “Let’s
talk about that. I ain’t so sure about who that—who that money belongs
to.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>am</i>, you see,” growled the dentist.</p>

<p>The old enmity between the two men, their ancient hate, was flaming
up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t try an’ load that gun either,” cried McTeague, fixing Marcus
with his little eyes.</p>

<p>“Then don’t lay your finger on that sack,” shouted the other.
“You’re my prisoner, do you understand? You’ll do as I say.”
Marcus had drawn the handcuffs from his pocket, and stood ready
with his revolver held as a club. “You soldiered me out of that
money once, and played me for a sucker, an’ it’s <i>my</i> turn now. Don’t
you lay your finger on that sack.”</p>

<p>Marcus barred McTeague’s way, white with passion. McTeague
did not answer. His eyes drew to two fine, twinkling points, and his
enormous hands knotted themselves into fists, hard as wooden mallets.
He moved a step nearer to Marcus, then another.</p>

<p>Suddenly the men grappled, and in another instant were rolling and
struggling upon the hot, white ground. McTeague thrust Marcus
backward until he tripped and fell over the body of the dead mule.
The little bird-cage broke from the saddle with the violence of their
fall, and rolled out upon the ground, the flour-bags slipping from it.
McTeague tore the revolver from Marcus’s grip and struck out with
it blindly. Clouds of alkali dust, fine and pungent, enveloped the two
fighting men, all but strangling them.</p>

<p>McTeague did not know how he killed his enemy, but all at once
Marcus grew still beneath his blows. Then there was a sudden last
return of energy. McTeague’s right wrist was caught, something
clicked upon it, then the struggling body fell limp and motionless with
a long breath.</p>

<p>As McTeague rose to his feet, he felt a pull at his right wrist;
something held it fast. Looking down, he saw that Marcus in that
last struggle had found strength to handcuff their right wrists together.
Marcus was dead now; McTeague was locked to the body.
All about him, vast, interminable, stretched the measureless leagues
of Death Valley.</p>

<p>McTeague remained stupidly looking around him, now at the distant
horizon, now at the ground, now at the half-dead canary chittering
feebly in its little gilt prison.—Arranged from “McTeague.” Copyright

<h5>MICHAEL STROGOFF, COURIER OF THE CZAR</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Jules Verne</span></p>

<p>The door of the imperial cabinet was opened and General Kissoff
was announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“The courier?” inquired the Czar eagerly.</p>

<p>“He is here, sire,” replied General Kissoff.</p>

<p>“Let him come in,” said the Czar.</p>

<p>In a few moments Michael Strogoff, the courier, entered. The
Czar fixed a penetrating look upon him without uttering a word.
Then in an abrupt tone—</p>

<p>“Thy name?”</p>

<p>“Michael Strogoff, sire.”</p>

<p>“Thy rank?”</p>

<p>“Captain in the corps of Couriers to the Czar.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost know Siberia?”</p>

<p>“I am a Siberian.”</p>

<p>“A native of—?”</p>

<p>“Omsk, sire.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou relations there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire, my aged mother.”</p>

<p>The Czar suspended his questions for a moment; then pointed to
a letter which he held in his hand:</p>

<p>“Here is a letter which I charge thee, Michael Strogoff, to deliver
into the hands of the Grand Duke, and to no one but him.”</p>

<p>“I will deliver it, sire.”</p>

<p>“The Grand Duke is at Irkutsk. Thou wilt have to traverse a rebellious
country, invaded by Tartars, whose interest it will be to
intercept this letter.”</p>

<p>“I will traverse it.”</p>

<p>“Above all, beware of the traitor, Ivan Ogareff, who will perhaps
meet thee on the way.”</p>

<p>“I will beware of him.”</p>

<p>“Wilt thou pass through Omsk?”</p>

<p>“Sire, that is my route.”</p>

<p>“If thou dost see thy mother, there will be the risk of being recognized.
Thou must not see her!”</p>

<p>Michael Strogoff hesitated a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“I will not see her.”</p>

<p>“Swear to me that nothing will make thee acknowledge who thou
art, nor whither thou art going.”</p>

<p>“I swear it.”</p>

<p>“Michael Strogoff, take this letter. On it depends the safety of all
Siberia, and perhaps the life of my brother, the Grand Duke.”</p>

<p>“This letter shall be delivered to His Highness, the Grand Duke.”</p>

<p>“Go, thou, for God, for the Czar, and for your native land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>The courier saluted his sovereign and that very night set out to fulfill
his perilous mission. All went well until he reached Omsk. Compelled
to stop here for food and a change of horses, he was about
to leave the posting house to continue his journey when suddenly a
cry made him tremble—a cry which penetrated to the depths of his
soul—and these two words rushed into his ear: “My son!”</p>

<p>His mother, the old woman, Marfa, was before him! Trembling,
she smiled upon him and stretched forth her arms to him. Michael
Strogoff stepped forward; he was about to throw himself—when the
thought of duty, the serious danger to himself, and his mother, in
this unfortunate meeting, stopped him, and so great was his self-command
that not a muscle of his face moved. There were twenty people
in the public room, and among them perhaps spies, and was it not
known that the son of Marfa Strogoff belonged to the corps of
Couriers to the Czar? Michael Strogoff did not move.</p>

<p>“Michael!” cried his mother.</p>

<p>“Who are you, my good woman?”</p>

<p>“Who am I? Dost thou no longer know thy mother?”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken; a resemblance deceives you.”</p>

<p>Marfa went up to him, and looking straight into his eyes, said:
“Art thou not the son of Peter and Marfa Strogoff?”</p>

<p>Michael would have given his life to have locked his mother in his
arms. But if he yielded now it was all over with him, with her, with
his mission, with his oath. Completely master of himself, he closed
his eyes that he might not see the inexpressible anguish of his mother.</p>

<p>“I do not know, in truth, what it is you say, my good woman.”</p>

<p>“Michael!”</p>

<p>“My name is not Michael. I never was your son! I am Nicholas
Kopanoff, a merchant of Irkutsk.”</p>

<p>And suddenly he left the room, while for the last time the words
echoed in his ears,—</p>

<p>“My son! My son!”</p>

<p>Michael Strogoff by a desperate effort had gone. He did not heed his
old mother, who had fallen back almost inanimate on a bench. But
when the postmaster hastened to assist her, the aged woman raised
herself. Suddenly the thought occurred to her: She denied by her
own son. It was impossible! As for being deceived, it was equally
impossible. It was certainly her son whom she had just seen; and if
he had not recognized her it was because he had some strong reason
for acting thus. And then, her mother-feelings arising within her,
she had only one thought: Can I unwittingly have ruined him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“I am mad,” she said to her interrogators. “This young man was
not my son; he had not his voice. Let us think no more of it. If
we do, I shall end in finding him everywhere.”</p>

<p>This scene, however, was immediately reported to Ivan Ogareff, who
was stationed in the town. He at once arrested Michael Strogoff, and
then had Marfa brought before him. Marfa, standing before Ivan
Ogareff, drew herself up, crossed her arms on her breast, and waited.
“You are Marfa Strogoff?” asked Ogareff.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you retract what you said a few hours ago?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not know that your son, Michael Strogoff, Courier to
the Czar, has passed through Omsk?”</p>

<p>“I do not know it.”</p>

<p>“And the man whom you thought you recognized as your son was
not your son?”</p>

<p>“He was not my son.”</p>

<p>“And since then, you have seen him among the prisoners?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“If he were pointed out to you, would you recognize him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Listen! Your son is here, and you shall immediately point him
out to me.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“All these men will file before you, and if you do not show me
Michael Strogoff, you shall receive as many blows from the knout
as men shall have passed before you.”</p>

<p>On an order from Ogareff, the prisoners filed one by one past
Marfa, who was immovable as a statue, and whose face expressed only
perfect indifference. Michael was to all appearances unmoved, but
the palms of his hands bled under the nails which were pressed into
the flesh.</p>

<p>Marfa, seized by two soldiers, was forced on her knees on the
ground. Her dress torn off left her back bare. A saber was placed
before her breast at a few inches’ distance. If she bent beneath her
sufferings, her breast would be pierced by the sharp steel. The Tartar
drew himself up and waited.</p>

<p>“Begin,” said Ogareff.</p>

<p>The whip whistled through the air, but, before it fell, a powerful
hand stopped the Tartar’s arm. Ivan Ogareff had succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“Michael Strogoff!” cried he.</p>

<p>“Himself!” said Michael, and raising the knout, he struck Ogareff
a blow across the face.</p>

<p>“Blow for blow!” said he.</p>

<p>Twenty soldiers threw themselves on Michael and in another instant
he would have been slain, but Ogareff stopped them.</p>

<p>“This man is reserved for the Emir’s judgment. Search him.”</p>

<p>The letter bearing the imperial arms was found in Michael’s bosom;
he had not time to destroy it. It was handed to Ogareff. Michael
was then led before the Emir.</p>

<p>“Your forehead to the ground!” exclaimed Ogareff.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>Two soldiers tried to make him bend, but were themselves laid on
the ground by a blow from Michael’s fist.</p>

<p>“Who is this prisoner?” asked the Emir.</p>

<p>“A Russian spy,” answered Ogareff.</p>

<p>In asserting that Michael was a spy, he knew that the sentence
would be terrible. The Emir made a sign, at which all bowed low
their heads. Then he pointed to the Koran, which was brought to
him. He opened the sacred book, and placing his finger on one of its
pages, read in a loud voice a verse ending in these words: “And he
shall no more see the things of this earth.”</p>

<p>“Russian spy, you have come to see what is going on in the Tartar
camp; then look while you may! You have seen for the last
time. In an instant your eyes will be for ever shut to the light of
day.”</p>

<p>Michael’s fate was to be not death, but blindness. He was going to
be blinded in the Tartar fashion, with a hot saber-blade passed before
his eyes.</p>

<p>The Emir’s orders executed, Ivan Ogareff approached Michael, drew
from his pocket the Imperial letter, opened it and held it up before
the face of the Czar’s courier, saying with supreme irony:</p>

<p>“Read, now, Michael Strogoff, read, and go and repeat at Irkutsk
what you have read. The true Courier of the Czar is henceforth Ivan
Ogareff.”</p>

<p>The Emir retired with his train. Ivan followed after, and sightless
Michael was left alone to his fate. One thought possessed him. He
must somehow arrive at Irkutsk before the traitor and warn the Grand
Duke of the intended deception.</p>

<p>Some months later Michael Strogoff had reached his journey’s end!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
He was in Irkutsk. Hastening to the governor’s palace to see the
Grand Duke, he meets in a waiting-room Ivan Ogareff, the traitor.
The latter must act quickly. Ogareff arose, and thinking he had an
immeasureable advantage over the blind man threw himself upon him.
But with one hand Michael grasps the arm of his enemy and hurls
him to the ground. Ogareff gathers himself together like a tiger about
to spring, and utters not a word. The noise of his footsteps, his very
breathing, he tries to conceal from the blind man. At last, with a
spring, he drives his sword full blast at Michael’s breast. An imperceptible
movement of the blind man’s knife turns aside the blow.
Michael is not touched, and coolly waits a second attack. Cold drops
stand on Ogareff’s brow; he draws back a step and again leaps forward.
But like the first, this attempt fails. Michael’s knife has parried
the blow from the traitor’s useless sword. Mad with rage and
terror, he gazes into the wide-open eyes of the blind man. Those eyes
which seem to pierce to the bottom of his soul, and which do not,
cannot, see, exercise a sort of dreadful fascination over him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ogareff utters a cry: “He sees! He sees!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. Thinking of my mother, the tears which sprang to my
eyes saved my sight. I see the mark of the knout which I gave you,
traitor and coward! I see the place where I am about to strike you!
Defend your life! It is a duel I offer you! My knife against your
sword!”</p>

<p>Ogareff now feels that he is lost, but, mustering up all his courage,
he springs forward. The two blades cross, but at a touch from
Michael’s knife the sword flies in splinters, and the wretch, stabbed
to the heart, falls lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>At the same moment the door is thrown open, and the Grand Duke,
accompanied by some of his officers, enters. The Grand Duke advances.
In the body lying on the ground he recognizes the man whom
he believes to be the Czar’s Courier. Then in threatening voice:</p>

<p>“Who killed this man?”</p>

<p>“I,” answered Michael.</p>

<p>“Thy name? Who dares kill the servant of my brother, the Czar’s
Courier?”</p>

<p>“That man, your highness, is not a Courier of the Czar! He is Ivan
Ogareff!”</p>

<p>“Ivan Ogareff!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ivan the traitor.”</p>

<p>“But who are you, then?”</p>

<p>“Michael Strogoff.”</p>

<h5>THE TIGER’S CAVE<br>
<span class="smaller">AN ADVENTURE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF QUITO</span></h5>

<p>On leaving the Indian village, we continued to wind round Chimborazo’s
wide base; but its snow-crowned head no longer shone above
us in clear brilliancy, for a dense fog was gathering gradually around
it. Our guides looked anxiously towards it, and announced their
apprehensions of a violent storm. We soon found that their fears
were well founded. The fog rapidly covered and obscured the whole
of the mountain; the atmosphere was suffocating, and yet so humid
that the steelwork of our watches was covered with rust, and the
watches stopped. The river beside which we were traveling rushed
down with still greater impetuosity; and from the clefts of the rocks
which lay on the left of our path were suddenly precipitated small
rivulets that bore the roots of trees and innumerable serpents along
with them. These rivulets often came down so suddenly and violently
that we had great difficulty in preserving our footing. The
thunder at length began to roll, and resounded through the mountainous
passes with the most terrific grandeur. Then came the vivid
lightning, flash following flash—above, around, beneath—everywhere a
sea of fire. We sought a momentary shelter in a cleft of the rocks,
while one of our guides hastened forward to seek a more secure
asylum. In a short time he returned, and informed us that he had
discovered a spacious cavern, which would afford us sufficient protection
from the elements. We proceeded thither immediately, and with
great difficulty, and not a little danger, at last got into it.</p>

<p>The noise and raging of the storm continued with so much violence
that we could not hear the sound of our voices. I had placed myself
near the entrance of the cave, and could observe, through the opening,
which was straight and narrow, the singular scene without. The highest
cedar-trees were struck down, or bent like reeds; monkeys and
parrots lay strewed upon the ground, killed by the falling branches;
the water had collected in the path we had just passed, and hurried
along it like a mountain stream. From everything I saw I thought
it extremely probable that we should be obliged to pass some days in
this cavern. When the storm, however, had somewhat abated, our
guides ventured out in order to ascertain if it were possible to continue
our journey. The cave in which we had taken refuge was extremely
dark, so that if we moved a few paces from the entrance we could
see no more than an inch before us; and we were debating as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
propriety of leaving it, even before the Indians came back, when we
suddenly heard a singular rumbling or growling at the farther end of
the cavern, which instantly fixed all our attention. Wharton and
myself listened anxiously, but our daring and inconsiderate young
friend Lincoln, together with my huntsman, crept about upon their
hands and knees, and endeavored to discover, by groping, from whence
the sound proceeded. They had not advanced far into the cavern
before we heard them utter an exclamation of surprise; and they
returned to us, each carrying in his arms an animal singularly marked,
and about the size of a cat, seemingly of great strength and power,
and furnished with immense fangs. The eyes were of a green color;
strong claws were upon their feet; and a blood-red tongue hung out
of their mouths. Wharton had scarcely glanced at them, when he
exclaimed, in consternation, “Good God! we have come into the den
of a—.” He was interrupted by a fearful cry of dismay from our
guides, who came rushing precipitately towards us, calling out, “A
tiger! a tiger!” and at the same time, with extraordinary rapidity,
they climbed up a cedar-tree, which stood at the entrance of the cave,
and hid themselves among the branches.</p>

<p>After the first sensation of horror and surprise, which rendered me
motionless for a moment, had subsided, I grasped my firearms. Wharton
had already regained his composure and self-possession; and he
called to us to assist him instantly in blocking up the mouth of the
cave with an immense stone, which fortunately lay near it. The sense
of approaching danger augmented our strength, for we now distinctly
heard the growl of the ferocious animal, and we were lost beyond
redemption if it reached the entrance before we could get it closed.
Ere this was done, we could distinctly see the tiger bounding towards
the spot and stooping in order to creep into his den by the narrow
opening. At this fearful moment our exertions were successful, and
the great stone kept the wild beast at bay. There was a small open
space, however, left between the top of the entrance and the stone,
through which we could see the head of the animal, illuminated by its
glowing eyes, which rolled, glaring with fury, upon us. Its frightful
roaring, too, penetrated to the depths of the cavern, and was answered
by the hoarse growling of the cubs, which Lincoln and Frank had now
tossed from them. Our ferocious enemy attempted first to remove
the stone with his powerful claws, and then to push it with his head
from its place; and these efforts, proving abortive, served only to
increase his wrath. He uttered a tremendous, heart-piercing howl, and
his flaming eyes darted light into the darkness of our retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“Now is the time to fire at him,” said Wharton, with his usual calmness;
“aim at his eyes; the ball will go through his brain, and we
shall then have a chance to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>Frank seized his double-barreled gun, and Lincoln his pistols; the
former placed the muzzle within a few inches of the tiger, and Lincoln
did the same. At Wharton’s command, they both drew the triggers
at the same moment, but no shot followed. The tiger, who seemed
aware that the flash indicated an attack upon him, sprang growling
from the entrance, but, feeling himself unhurt, immediately turned
back again, and stationed himself in his former place. The powder in
both pieces was wet. Frank and Lincoln, therefore, proceeded to draw
the useless charges while Wharton and myself hastened to seek our
powder-flask. It was so extremely dark that we were obliged to grope
about the cave; and, at last, coming in contact with the cubs, we heard
a rustling noise, as if they were playing with some metal substance,
which we soon discovered was the cannister we were looking for.
Most unfortunately, however, the animals had pushed off the lid with
their claws, and the powder had been strewed over the damp earth
and rendered entirely useless. This fearful discovery excited the greatest
consternation.</p>

<p>“All is now over,” said Wharton. “We have only now to choose
whether we shall die of hunger, together with these animals who are
shut up along with us, or open the entrance to the blood-thirsty monster
without, and so make a quicker end of the matter.”</p>

<p>So saying, he placed himself close beside the stone, which, for the
moment, defended us, and looked undauntedly upon the lightning eyes
of the tiger.</p>

<p>Lincoln raved and swore; and Frank took a piece of strong cord
from his pocket and hastened to the farther end of the cave—I knew
not with what design. We soon, however, heard a low, stifled groaning;
and the tiger, who had heard it also, became more restless and
disturbed than ever. He went backwards and forwards before the
entrance of the cave, in the most wild, impetuous manner, then stood
still, and stretching out his neck in the direction of the forest, broke
forth into a deafening howl. Our two Indian guides took advantage
of this opportunity to discharge several arrows from the tree. The
animal was struck more than once, but the light weapons bounded
back harmless from his thick skin. At length, however, one of them
struck him near the eye, and the arrow remained sticking in the wound.
He now broke anew into the wildest fury, and sprang at the tree, and
tore it with his claws, as if he would have dragged it to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
But, having at length succeeded in getting rid of the arrow, became
more calm, and laid himself down as before in front of the cave.</p>

<p>Frank now returned from the lower end of the den, and a glance
showed us what he had been doing. In each hand, and dangling from
the end of a string, were the two cubs. He had strangled them, and
before we were aware what he intended, he threw them through the
opening to the tiger. No sooner did the animal perceive them, than
he gazed earnestly upon them, and began to examine them closely,
turning them cautiously from side to side. As soon as he became
aware that they were dead, he uttered so piercing a howl of sorrow
that we were obliged to put our hands to our ears. When I upbraided
my huntsman for the cruel action he had so rashly committed,
I perceived by his blunt and abrupt answers that he also had lost
all hope of rescue from our impending fate, and, that, under these
circumstances, the ties between master and servant were dissolved.
For my own part, without knowing why, I could not help believing
that some unexpected assistance would yet rescue us from so horrible
a fate. Alas! I little anticipated the sacrifice that my rescue was
to cost.</p>

<p>The thunder had now ceased, and the storm had sunk to a gentle
gale; the songs of the birds were again heard in the neighboring forest,
and the sunbeams sparkled in the drops that hung from the leaves.
We saw through the aperture that all nature was reviving after the
wild war of elements which had so recently taken place; but the contrast
only made our situation the more terrible. We were in a grave
from which there was no deliverance; and a monster, worse than the
fabled Cerberus, kept watch over us. The tiger had laid himself down
beside his whelps. He was a beautiful animal, of great size and
strength, and his limbs being stretched out at their full length, displayed
his immense power of muscle. A double row of great teeth
stood far enough apart to show his large red tongue, from which the
white foam fell in large drops. All at once, another roar was heard
at a distance, and the tiger immediately rose and answered it with
a mournful howl. At the same instant, our Indians uttered a shriek,
which announced that some new danger threatened us. A few moments
confirmed our worst fears, for another tiger, not quite so large
as the former, came rapidly towards the spot where we were.</p>

<p>“This enemy will prove more cruel than the other,” said Wharton;
“for this is the female, and she knows no pity for those who deprive
her of her young.”</p>

<p>The howls which the tigress gave when she had examined the bodies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
of her cubs, surpassed everything of the horrible that we had yet
heard; and the tiger mingled his mournful cries with hers. Suddenly
her roaring was lowered to a hoarse growling, and we saw her anxiously
stretch out her head, extend her wide and smoking nostrils, and
look as if she were determined to discover immediately the murderers
of her young. Her eyes quickly fell upon us, and she made a spring
forward with the intention of penetrating to our place of refuge.
Perhaps she might have been enabled by her immense strength to push
away the stone, had we not, with all our united power, held it against
her. When she found that all her efforts were fruitless she rejoined
the tiger, who lay stretched beside his cubs, and he arose and added
his howls to her hollow roarings. They stood together for a few
moments, as if in consultation, and then suddenly went off at a rapid
pace, and disappeared from our sight. Their howling died away in the
distance, and then entirely ceased. We now began to entertain better
hopes of our condition; but Wharton shook his head.</p>

<p>“Do not flatter yourselves,” said he, “with the belief that these animals
will let us escape out of their sight till they have had their
revenge. The hours we have to live are numbered.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there still appeared a chance for our rescue, for, to our
surprise, we saw both our Indians standing before the entrance, and
heard them call to us to seize the only possibility of our yet saving
ourselves by instant flight, for that the tigers had only gone round
the height to seek another inlet to the cave, with which they were no
doubt acquainted. In the greatest haste the stone was pushed aside,
and we stepped forth from what we had considered a living grave.
Wharton was the last who left it; he was unwilling to lose his double-barreled
gun, and stopped to take it up; the rest of us only thought
of making our escape. We now heard once more the roaring of the
tigers, though at a distance; and, following the example of our guides,
we precipitately struck into a sidepath. From the number of roots
and branches of trees with which the storm had strewed our way, and
the slipperiness of the road, our flight was slow and difficult. Wharton,
though an active seaman, had a heavy step, and had great difficulty
in keeping pace with us, and we were often obliged to slacken
our own on his account.</p>

<p>We had proceeded thus for about a quarter of an hour, when we
found that our way led along the edge of a rocky cliff, with innumerable
fissures. We had just entered upon it, when suddenly the Indians,
who were before us, uttered one of their piercing shrieks, and we
immediately became aware that the tigers were in pursuit of us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
Urged by despair, we rushed towards the breaks, or gulfs, in our way,
over which was thrown a bridge of reeds, that sprang up and down
at every step, and could be trodden with safety by the light foot of
the Indians alone. Deep in the hollow below rushed an impetuous
stream, and a thousand pointed and jagged rocks threatened destruction
on every side. Lincoln, my huntsman, and myself, passed over the
chasm in safety; but Wharton was still in the middle of the waving
bridge, and endeavoring to steady himself, when both the tigers were
seen to issue from the adjoining forest; and, the moment they descried
us they bounded towards us with dreadful roarings. Meanwhile,
Wharton had nearly gained the safe side of the gulf, and we were all
clambering the rocky cliff, except Lincoln, who remained at the reedy
bridge to assist his friend to step upon firm ground. Wharton,
though the ferocious animals were close upon him, never lost his
courage or presence of mind.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gained the edge of the cliff, he knelt down, and,
with the edge of his sword, divided the fastenings by which the bridge
was attached to the rock. He expected an effectual barrier would thus
be put to the farther progress of our pursuers; but he was mistaken;
for he had scarcely accomplished his task, when the tigress, without
a moment’s pause, rushed towards the chasm, and attempted to bound
over. It was a fearful sight to see the mighty animal, suspended for
a moment in the air above the abyss; but the scene passed like a flash
of lightning. Her strength was not equal to the distance; she fell into
the gulf, and before she reached the bottom, was torn into a thousand
pieces by the jagged points of the rocks. Her fate did not in the least
dismay her companion; he followed her with an immense spring, and
reached the opposite side, but only with his fore-claws, and thus he
clung to the edge of the precipice, endeavoring to gain a footing.
The Indians again uttered a wild shriek, as if all hope had been lost.
But Wharton, who was nearest to the edge of the rock, advanced
courageously towards the tiger, and struck his sword into the animal’s
breast. Enraged beyond all measure, the wild beast collected
all his strength, and with a violent effort, fixing one of his hind-legs
upon the edge of the cliff, he seized Wharton by the thigh. The
heroic man still preserved his fortitude; he grasped the trunk of à
tree with his left hand, to steady and support himself, while with his
right he wrenched and violently turned the sword that was still in
the breast of the tiger.</p>

<p>All this was the work of an instant. The Indians, Frank, and myself
hastened to his assistance; but Lincoln, who was already at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
side, had seized Wharton’s gun, which lay near by, upon the ground,
and struck so powerful a blow with the butt-end upon the head of the
tiger, that the animal, stunned and overpowered, let go his hold and
fell back into the abyss. All would have been well, had it ended thus;
but the unfortunate Lincoln had not calculated upon the force of his
blow; he staggered forward, reeled upon the edge of the precipice,
extended his hand to seize upon anything to save himself—but in
vain. His foot slipped; for an instant he hovered over the gulf, and
then was plunged into it to rise no more!—<i>Edinburgh Literary Journal.</i></p>

<h5>WHALE HUNTING</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. Ross Browne</span></p>

<p>“There she blows!” was sung out from the mast-head.</p>

<p>“Where away?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“Three points off the lee bow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Raise up your wheel. Steady!”</p>

<p>“Steady, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mast-head, ahoy! Do you see that whale now?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir! A school of sperm whales! There she blows!
There she breaches!”</p>

<p>“Sing out! Sing out every time!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir! There she blows! There—there—thar’ she blows—blowes—blo-o-o-s!”</p>

<p>“How far off!”</p>

<p>“Two miles and a half!”</p>

<p>“Thunder and lightning! so near! Call all hands! Clew up the
fore-t’gallant-sail—there! belay! Hard down your wheel! Haul aback
the main yard! Get your tubs in your boats! Bear a hand! Clear
your falls! Stand by all to lower! All ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir!”</p>

<p>“Lower away!”</p>

<p>Down went the boats with a splash. Each boat’s crew sprang over
the rail, and in an instant the larboard, starboard and waist boats
were manned. There was great rivalry in getting the start. The
waist-boat got off in pretty good time; and away went all three, dashing
the water high over their bows. Nothing could be more exciting
than the chase.</p>

<p>The larboard boat, commanded by the mate, and the waist-boat, by
the second mate, were head and head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“Give way, my lads, give way!” shouted our headsman; “we gain
on them; give way! A long, steady stroke! That’s the way to
tell it!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” cried Tabor, our boat-steerer. “What d’ye say, boys?
Shall we lick ’em?”</p>

<p>“Pull! pull like vengeance!” echoed the crew; and we danced over
the waves, scarcely seeming to touch them.</p>

<p>The chase was now truly soul-stirring. Sometimes the larboard,
then the starboard, then the waist-boat took the lead. It was a severe
trial of skill and muscle. After we had run two miles at this rate,
the whales turned flukes, going dead to windward.</p>

<p>“Now for it, my lads!” cried our headsman. “We’ll have them the
next rising. Now pile it on! a long, steady pull! That’s it! Don’t
give out! Half an hour more, and they’re our whales!”</p>

<p>The other boats had veered off at either side of us, and continued
the chase with renewed ardor. In about half an hour we lay on our
oars to look around for the whales.</p>

<p>“There she blows! right ahead!” shouted Tabor, fairly dancing with
delight.</p>

<p>“There she blows! There she blows!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, boys, spring!” cried our headsman.</p>

<p>“Spring it is! What d’ye say, now, chummies? Shall we take those
whales?”</p>

<p>To this general appeal every man replied by putting his weight on
his oar, and exerting his utmost strength. The boat flew through the
water with incredible swiftness, scarcely rising to the waves.</p>

<p>A large bull whale lay about a quarter of a mile ahead of us, lazily
rolling in the trough of the sea. The larboard and starboard boats
were far to leeward of us, tugging hard to get a chance at the other
whales, which were now blowing in every direction.</p>

<p>“Give way! give way, my hearties!” cried our headsman, putting his
weight against the aft oar. “Do you love gin? A bottle of gin to the
best man! Oh, pile it on while you have breath! pile it on!”</p>

<p>“On with the beef, chummies! Smash every oar! double ’em up,
or break ’em!”</p>

<p>“Every devil’s imp of you, pull! No talking; lay back to it; now
or never!”</p>

<p>On dashed the boat, cleaving its way through the rough sea as if
the briny element were blue smoke. The whale, however, turned flukes
before we could reach him. When he appeared again above the surface
of the water, it was evident that he had milled while down, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
which maneuver he gained on us nearly a mile. The chase was now
almost hopeless, as he was making to windward rapidly. A heavy,
black cloud was on the horizon, portending an approaching squall, and
the barque was fast fading from sight. Still we were not to be baffled
by discouraging circumstances of this kind, and we braced our
sinews for a grand and final effort.</p>

<p>“Never give up, my lads!” said the headsman, in a cheering voice.
“Mark my words, we’ll have that whale yet. Only think he’s ours,
and there’s no mistake about it, he will be ours. Now for a hard,
steady pull! Give way!”</p>

<p>“Give way, sir! Give way, all!”</p>

<p>“There she blows! Oh, pull my lively lads! Only a mile off!
There she blows!”</p>

<p>The wind by this time had increased almost to a gale, and the heavy
black clouds were scattering over us far and wide. Part of the squall
had passed off to leeward and entirely concealed the barque. Our situation
was rather unpleasant: in a rough sea, the other boats out of
sight, and each moment the wind increasing.</p>

<p>We continued to strain every muscle till we were hard upon the
whale. Tabor sprang to the bow, and stood by with the harpoon.</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, my lads,” said the headsman.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Hush-h-h! softly. Now’s your time, Tabor!”</p>

<p>Tabor let fly the harpoon, and buried the iron.</p>

<p>“Give him another!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye! Stern all!”</p>

<p>“Stern all!” thundered the headsman.</p>

<p>“Stern all!”</p>

<p>And, as we rapidly backed from the whale, he flung his tremendous
flukes high in the air, covering us with a cloud of spray. He then
sounded, making the line whiz as it passed through the chocks. When
he rose to the surface again, we hauled up, and the second mate stood
ready in the bow to dispatch him with lances.</p>

<p>“Spouting blood!” said Tabor. “He’s a dead whale! He won’t need
much lancing.”</p>

<p>It was true enough; for, before the officer could get within dart of
him, he commenced his dying struggles. The sea was crimsoned with
his blood. By the time we had reached him, he was belly up. We
lay upon our oars a moment to witness his last throes, and, when he
had turned his head toward the sun, a loud, simultaneous cheer burst
from every lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>A low, rumbling sound, like the roar of a distant waterfall, now
reached our ears. Each moment it grew louder.</p>

<p>The whole expansive arch of the heavens became dark with clouds
tossing, flying, swelling, and whirling over and over, like the surges
of an angry sea. A white cloud, gleaming against the black mass
behind it, came sweeping toward us, stretching forth its long, white
arms, as if to grasp us in its fatal embrace. Louder and still louder
it growled; yet the air was still and heavy around us. Now the white
cloud spread, whirled over, and lost its hoary head; now it wore the
mane and forefeet of a lion; now the heads of a dragon, with their
tremendous jaws extended. Writhing, hissing, roaring, it swept toward
us. The demon of wrath could not have assumed a more frightful
form. The whole face of the ocean was hidden in utter darkness,
save within a circle of a few hundred yards. Our little boat floated
on a sea almost unruffled by a breath of wind. The heavy swell rolled
lazily past us; yet a death-like calmness reigned in the air. Beyond
the circle all was strife; within, all peace. We gazed anxiously in
each other’s faces; but not a word was spoken. Even the veteran
harpooner looked upon the clouds with a face of unusual solemnity,
as we lay upon our oars, awed to silence by the sublimity of the
scene. The ominous stillness of everything within the circle became
painful. For many long minutes the surface of the water remained
nearly smooth. We dreaded, but longed for a change. This state of
suspense was growing intolerable. I could hear the deep, long-drawn
respirations of those around me; I saw the quick, anxious glances they
turned to windward; and I almost fancied I could read every thought
that passed within their breasts.</p>

<p>Suddenly a white streak of foam appeared within a hundred yards.
Scarcely had we unshipped our oars, when the squall burst upon us
with stunning violence. The weather side of the boat was raised high
out of the water, and the rushing foam dashed over the gunwale in
torrents. We soon trimmed her, however, and, by hard bailing, got
her clear of water. It is utterly impossible to conceive the violence
of the wind. Small as the surface exposed to the squall was, we
flew through the foaming seas, dragging the dead body of the whale
after us with incredible velocity. Thus situated, entirely at the mercy
of the wind and sea, we continued every moment to increase our
distance from the barque. When the squall abated, we came to under
the lee of the whale, and looked to leeward for the barque. Not a
speck could be seen on the horizon! Night was rapidly approaching,
and we were alone upon the broad, angry ocean!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“Ship your oars,” said the headsman; “we’ll not part company with
old blubber yet. If we can’t make the barque, we can make land
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said Tabor, with a sly leer, “and live on roast-beef and
turkey while we’re making it.”</p>

<p>With heavy hearts and many misgivings we shipped our oars, heartily
wishing the whale in the devil’s try-pots; for we thought it rather
hard that our lives should be risked for a few barrels of oil. For
two hours we pulled a long, lazy, dogged stroke, without a sign of
relief. At last Tabor stood up on the bow to look out, and we lay
on our oars.</p>

<p>“Well, Tabor, what d’ye see?” was the general inquiry.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Tabor, coolly rolling the quid from his weather to his
lee cheek, “I see a cussed old barque that looks like Granny Howland’s
wash-tub, with a few broomsticks rigged up in the middle of it.”</p>

<p>“Pull, you devils!” cried our headsman; “there’s duff in the cook’s
coppers.”</p>

<p>“Yes! I think I smell it,” said Tabor.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when we arrived alongside of the barque with
our prize; but what was our surprise to find that the starboard and
larboard boats had killed five whales between them! They were all
of a small size, and did not average more than fifteen barrels each.</p>

<p>That night not a breath of air ruffled the clear, broad ocean as it
swelled beneath and around us, forming a multitude of mirrors that
reflected all the beauties of the splendid canopy above. The moon
arose with unusual brilliancy. It was a night for the winged spirits
of the air. I enjoyed a melancholy pleasure in walking the decks
beneath the soft moonbeams, thinking of past times. Silence reigned
over the deep. The calm, broad ocean presented a beautiful simile
of repose, and the light, shadowy clouds floated motionless in the air,
as if in awe of the mighty wilderness of waters beneath them. A
clear, silvery light beamed over the glassy swell; and far away the
moon’s rays, casting their soft and delicate glow over the whole
scene, gradually vanished in a dreamy haze upon the horizon. I
gazed with pensive feelings upon this scene; so calm, so heavenly, so
unrivaled in its loveliness; and I thought, with a sigh, of the coming
day: the fiery, tropical sun; the heat and smoke of the try-works; and
all the realities of a whaleman’s life. I have heard of the solitude of
the desert; but what can compare with that of the ocean at such a
time as this?</p>

<p>Never had the sea looked more beautiful than it did that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>It was a source of pleasure to feel that, notwithstanding the
wretched life I led, there were still left a few of the better feelings
of my nature. A passage in the “Vision of Don Roderic” occurred to
me as singularly expressive of the checkered fortunes of a seafarer.
Well might I hope the light cloud which occasionally obscured the
moon’s brightness might prove a happy omen of my future fate:</p>

<h5>THE MAN IN THE SHADOW</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By R. W. Child</span></p>

<p>The late afternoon sunlight slanted down into the busy street
through the trees of the Public Garden. It had been the sort of day
which whispers of other scenes, old faces, gentle memories and
painted possibilities. Now along the street came the ebb-tide of the
day’s work swept out from the business part of the city and jostling
homeward.</p>

<p>Among the home-goers was a man distinguished a little from the
rest by a refined and patient expression. His shoulders sloped as if
they had borne much; his eyes were open in a stare as if astounded
at the repetition of life’s misfortunes; and his clothes, from his derby
hat, shiny from his wife’s endless brushings, to his shoes, flattened by
the monotony of his daily life, told of the practice of much respectable
economy. Trouble had felt of his throat, one would say, but
never had succeeded in throttling him. There was a quiet, reserved
strength in the furrows of his forehead and in the solidity of his chin,
and the wrinkles at the corner of his blue eyes declared that there
was a fund of persistent hope in Carter Clews.</p>

<p>Looking up suddenly he saw four men coming down the steps of a
hotel toward an open carriage which had drawn up to the curb. Three
were inclined to the stoutness of middle age, and all were laughing
prosperously, and chatting vociferously of Commencement dinners and
baseball games and class reunions; it was evident that they were four
successful men on a holiday and straining to be young again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Carter Clews smiled with boyish pleasure, for one of them was
“Newt” Riggs, who used to row on the crew and was now a corporation
attorney in Chicago; and there was Billy Drowson, who used to
flunk examinations as easily as if he meant to do it; and the third
was Joe Crane, who was making his two hundred thousand a year in
metal refining in Colorado; and the little man was Lapham, the surgeon,
who had been marshal of the class.</p>

<p>The last had just seated himself comfortably in the carriage, when
Clews succeeded in pushing his way into the gap they had left in the
crowd. Both Joseph Crane and Lapham, seeing him take a step toward
them, opened their eyes in innocent surprise; neither of them
recognized him. He stopped for a moment of embarrassed hesitation,
and in that moment he felt with the sharp old pang that he belonged
among them no more. They were successful men.</p>

<p>Carter Clews stepped back into the gray shadow of the portico. The
carriage started away with a laugh and the scrape of a wheel on the
curb, and Clews started on his way once more. His daily trudge to
and from his office was the result of a calculation that enough car
fare each year was saved to buy an extra gown for his daughter.
Life had toyed with him, showing her splendors and snatching
them from his fingers; had taught him culture and then laughed at
him.</p>

<p>The rattle of his key brought his wife to the door, and the usual
smiles and kisses of welcome reminded him of the old duty of keeping
his feelings to himself.</p>

<p>“Was there any mail to-day?”</p>

<p>“There was a postal-card came to-day for you, dad. It had been
to all of the four places we have lived since we came back from Iowa,
and so it was late in getting here. It was the announcement of the
twenty-fifth anniversary dinner of your class; you’ll go, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Where’s the postal?”</p>

<p>“Do go, dad, we don’t like to have you forgotten. It’s only six.
The dinner’s at eight. You’ll have plenty of time, father.”</p>

<p>Clews took the card, holding it under the light of the lamp on the
center-table. His fingers trembled a little as he read it.</p>

<p>“The last dinner I went to was in our Senior year, just before I
graduated and went West; I was toastmaster at that dinner. It was
a spring night like this. I remember a little crowd of us sat under a
tree in the college yard and talked until daylight. We promised each
other, half in fun, that the one who got to be forty-five years old and
wasn’t successful should jump into the river. And then we went up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
to my room for a cold bath, and I built a fire and heated the poker
and burned my name into the mantel-piece.”</p>

<p>He tossed the card aside. His wife could see upon his face the
unmistakable sign that the accumulation of years of disappointment
was no longer to be contained in silence.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a miserable fizzle! Unknown and forgotten because I
deserve it!”</p>

<p>Edith looked straight at him. “That is not true,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s a bad dream! It’s been my fault. No wonder I’m
forgotten! Everybody flocks around a victor, but who cares where the
man is who failed to do big things? Once he marched in the front
line promising a great deal, and now he’s got to watch the procession
from the sidewalk. It would be better, if a man can’t make himself
felt and has got to walk around unknown—to keep his promise and—”</p>

<p>“Don’t, father.”</p>

<p>He looked up into his daughter’s face, and seeing the trembling of
her upper lip, drew a long breath and squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we all have our compensations.”</p>

<p>“You are going to the class dinner, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I think I won’t go this time. Perhaps next year—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, for me! I’ll get your evening clothes. They’re put away.”</p>

<p>When he appeared in them a little later, he looked doubtfully at
himself in the mirror, then suddenly smiled.</p>

<p>“I’ve had them ever since we were married. Their style looks
rather quaint, doesn’t it? But I’ve had some very happy minutes inside
the old coat. Do you remember this tie, Alice?”</p>

<p>“Why, for mercy’s sake! That was the first thing I ever made you!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten,” he answered.</p>

<p>As he went slowly out into the hallway and down the noisy wooden
stairs, his wife and daughter leaned over the banisters looking at him
anxiously.</p>

<p>At last he turned the corner into the avenue. As he looked, he saw
a little group of laughing men going up the steps; then he squared his
shoulders, and walked briskly across the street and up the steps into
the lobby.</p>

<p>The clerk leaned over the desk toward him. “Seventy-six?” Clews
nodded: “Yes, my class—Seventy-six.”</p>

<p>“Just down at the end of that corridor.”</p>

<p>There were others standing with him at the checkroom, who nodded
to him.</p>

<p>“Did you go to the game?” asked one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“No. How did it come out?”</p>

<p>“Great guns! don’t you know how it came out? Why, we beat ’em!
My boy plays first base. I go to all the games.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could. I wish I had gone to-day, but my work is rather
confining. I have a daughter, and, of course, if I had a son, he’d be
out there at the University too.”</p>

<p>“There are several prominent members of the class here to-night.
Drowson is here, and Crane is toastmaster. We’re late, I think.”</p>

<p>With his new acquaintance Clews followed a knot of men who
opened the door, exposing two large tables filled with diners. The
noise within burst out and drew the attention of several guests of the
hotel, who peered down the corridor with mild curiosity.</p>

<p>When the man who was with Clews hesitated for a moment, a dozen
voices rose up to greet him, and several men stood up to shout, “Oh,
Billy, here’s a seat!” or “Here you are, Lawton!”</p>

<p>Clews was lonely. Of the men who sat near him he remembered
only two as acquaintances of undergraduate days, and the old associations
recalled by their faces were so hazy that he was convinced
that he had never known either of them well. They certainly did not
recognize him. He determined grimly never to suffer another experience
like this.</p>

<p>“The world likes success and sunlight,” he said to himself. “I’ll
fight it out alone after this, and in my own little corner.”</p>

<p>A waiter finally thrust a demi-tasse of coffee deftly over Clew’s
elbow. Crane had introduced Drowson with an accompaniment of
cheers and hand-clapping, and Drowson had made a speech which had
impressed every one, and Collingwood had been cajoled into singing
an old song. Chairs were gradually moved back a little from the
table, the room became foggy with the smoke that curled from the
cigars, and a contented fullness and laughter tugged at nearly a hundred
waistcoats.</p>

<p>Crane, the toastmaster, was rapping for silence.</p>

<p>“Before we break up,” he said, “I want you to drink one more
toast with me. We have toasted ourselves and each other, but this
toast is to a man who is not here.”</p>

<p>The interest and curiosity of every one was aroused. Even Clews
leaned back in his chair to listen; it was plainly going to be a eulogy
of some classman who had died.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five years ago, after our last college dinner, there were six
men in our class sitting together under a tree in the yard and talking
about what we would do. We said we would all be successful at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
forty-five. If not, we were going to jump into the river. I was one
of those men—Billy Drowson was another; Wright was there—he died
the next year. Then there was Lapham and Riggs. But there was
another. He was a prominent figure in our class—the smartest one
of the six—very honorable and good-hearted. I will not name him.
He is not here. We all thought he would have a brilliant career.
He came out of college and was married, and his father died and left
him a mother and two sisters and an inheritance of debts. That cut
him off from the professional schools, and he went West, and I have
found out that he went into a business where there was no chance in
the world of advancement. But it had to be done because that offered
a way of bearing the burdens and obligations that were on him.
It was just like him. Then he had to take care of a wife and three
others besides.</p>

<p>“His health became very bad—he used to work sixteen hours a day
sometimes, and when he was forty years old he found himself very
much out of order. Then he came back East. Part of his burdens
had been removed, but it was too late to start life as he might have
started it once. He had burned out in the service like a faithful,
honest, well-made candle. His light had been dim, but it had also
been steady. I suppose he is alive, although I don’t know. But all
of us who knew him best are sure that wherever he is, he is still
putting up a good fight, and though he hasn’t got the cheers and the
lime-light, he’s pulling mighty well. I know it!”</p>

<p>The room was very still while Crane paused.</p>

<p>“We’ve tried to locate him, but we lost the scent after we found he
had come back from Iowa. We had planned to go back to-night,
Drowson and Lapham and Riggs and myself and this other man, and
sit under the tree in the yard where twenty-five years ago we’d promised
to reach success, before we came back to attend this dinner. I
feel sure that this missing man—this lost member of the class, I
might say, for I can’t find any one who knows where he is—ought to
be there. We think he comes as near success as any one of us.</p>

<p>“We learned years ago at the University that faithful duty really
counted; the kind of success we are looking for isn’t always gilt-edged;
the band isn’t always playing for it to march by! When I
looked up this man I found a good, clean, honest story—a story of
devotion and loyalty and the kind of courage that holds out when
nobody is looking on or waving hats! I think we all ought to be
glad he is a ‘Seventy-six’ man, and that we are not so narrow or
ignorant as to count him a lost cause and a failure. I want you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
drink a toast to him with me—gentlemen, to the man who does his job
in a shadow!”</p>

<p>The whole class came to its feet together! Clews realized that
toast was to him. Had his head been cool, he would have arisen with
the rest unmarked and unknown—it was the old custom of remaining
seated when so honored that betrayed him. It left him a second behind
the rest, and the speaker’s big blue eyes were upon him at once.
Crane lowered his glass and exclaimed, “Good God!”</p>

<p>Clews stumbled back into his chair. “Seventy-six” raised its voice
in a great, generous roar. Clews looked up with wet cheeks and
smiled like a pleased boy. This was his class, cheering—and for him!</p>

<p>Later in the night Clews returned to his wife and daughter. Governor
William Drowson was with him.</p>

<p>“Alice,” said Carter Clews, “this is Billy. I roomed with him when
I was a freshman. He’s going to spend the night with me.”</p>

<h5>A WINDSTORM IN THE FORESTS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Muir</span></p>

<p>One of the most beautiful and exhilarating storms I ever enjoyed in
the Sierra occurred in December, 1874, when I happened to be exploring
one of the tributary valleys of the Yuba River. The sky and
the ground and the trees had been thoroughly rain-washed and were
dry again. The day was intensely pure, one of those incomparable
bits of California winter, warm and balmy and full of white sparkling
sunshine, redolent of all the purest influences of the spring, and at the
same time enlivened with one of the most bracing wind-storms conceivable.
Instead of camping out, as I usually do, I then chanced to
be stopping at the house of a friend. But when the storm began to
sound, I lost no time in pushing out into the woods to enjoy it. For
on such occasions Nature has always something rare to show us, and
the danger to life and limb is hardly greater than one would experience
crouching deprecatingly beneath a roof.</p>

<p>It was still early morning when I found myself fairly adrift. Delicious
sunshine came pouring over the hills, lighting the tops of the
pines, and setting free a stream of summery fragrance that contrasted
strangely with the wild tones of the storm. The air was mottled with
pine-tassels and bright green plumes that went flashing past in the sunlight
like birds pursued. But there was not the slightest dustiness,
nothing less pure than leaves, and ripe pollen, and flecks of withered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
bracken and moss. I heard trees falling for hours at the rate of one
every two or three minutes; some uprooted, partly on account of the
loose, water-soaked condition of the ground; others broken straight
across, where some weakness caused by fire had determined the spot.
The gestures of the various trees made a delightful study. Young
Sugar Pines, light and feathery as squirrel-tails, were bowing almost
to the ground; while the grand old patriarchs, whose massive boles
had been tried in a hundred storms, waved solemnly above them, their
long, arching branches streaming fluently in the gale, and every needle
thrilling and ringing and shedding off keen lances of light like a diamond.
The Douglas Spruces, with long sprays drawn out in level
tresses and needles massed in a gray, shimmering glow, presented a
most striking appearance as they stood in bold relief along the hill-tops.
The Madroños in the dells, with their red bark and large, glossy
leaves tilted every way, reflected the sunshine in throbbing spangles
like those one so often sees on the rippled surface of a glacier lake.
But the Silver Pines were now the most impressively beautiful of all.
Colossal spires 200 feet in height waved like supple goldenrods chanting
and bowing low as if in worship, while the whole mass of their
long, tremulous foliage was kindled into one continuous blaze of white
sun-fire. The force of the gale was such that the most steadfast monarch
of them all rocked down to its roots with a motion plainly perceptible
when one leaned against it. Nature was holding high festival,
and every fiber of the most rigid giants thrilled with glad excitement.</p>

<p>I drifted on through the midst of this passionate music and motion,
across many a glen, from ridge to ridge; often halting in the lee of a
rock for shelter, or to gaze and listen. Even when the grand anthem
had swelled to its highest pitch I could distinctly hear the varying
tones of individual trees,—Spruce, and Fir, and Pine, and leafless Oak,—and
even the infinitely gentle rustle of the withered grasses at my
feet. Each was expressing itself in its own way,—singing its own
song, and making its own peculiar gestures,—manifesting a richness
of variety to be found in no other forest I have yet seen....</p>

<p>Toward midday, after a long, tingling scramble through copses of
hazel and ceanothus, I gained the summit of the highest ridge in the
neighborhood; and then it occurred to me that it would be a fine
thing to climb one of the trees to obtain a wider outlook and get my
ear close to the Eolian music of its topmost needles. But under the
circumstances the choice of a tree was a serious matter. One whose
instep was not very strong, seemed in danger of being blown down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
or of being struck by others in case they should fall; another
was branchless to a considerable height above the ground, and at the
same time too large to be grasped with arms and legs in climbing;
while others were not favorably situated for clear views. After cautiously
casting about, I made choice of the tallest of a group of
Douglas Spruces that were growing close together like a tuft of grass;
no one of which seemed likely to fall unless all the rest fell with it.
Though comparatively young, they were about 100 feet high, and their
lithe, brushy tops were rocking and swirling in wild ecstasy. Being
accustomed to climb trees in botanical studies, I experienced no difficulty
in reaching the top of this one, and never before did I enjoy so
noble an exhilaration of motion. The slender tops fairly flapped and
swished in the passionate torrent, bending and swirling backward and
forward, round and round, tracing indescribable combinations of vertical
and horizontal curves, while I clung with muscles firmly braced,
like a bobolink on a reed.</p>

<p>In its widest sweeps my tree-top described an arc of twenty to thirty
degrees, but I felt sure of its elastic temper, having seen others of the
same species still more severely tried—bent almost to the ground indeed,
in heavy snows—without breaking a fiber. I was therefore safe, and
free to take the wind into my pulses and enjoy the excited forest from
my superb outlook. The view from here must be extremely beautiful
in any weather. Now my eye roved over the piny hills and dales as
over fields of waving grain, and felt the light running in ripples and
broad, swelling undulations across the valleys from ridge to ridge, as
the shining foliage was stirred by corresponding waves of air. Oftentimes
these waves of reflected light would break up suddenly into a
kind of beaten foam, and again, after chasing one another in regular
order, they would seem to bend forward in concentric curves, and
disappear on some hillside, like sea-waves on a shelving shore. The
quantity of light reflected from the bent needles was so great as to
make whole groves appear as if covered with snow, while the black
shadows beneath the trees greatly enhanced the effect of the silvery
splendor.... The sounds of the storm corresponded gloriously with
this wild exuberance of light and motion. The profound bass of the
naked branches and poles booming like waterfalls; the quick, tense
vibrations of the pine-needles, now rising to a shrill, whistling hiss,
now falling to a silky murmur; the rustling of laurel groves in the
dells, and the keen, metallic click of leaf on leaf—all this was heard
in easy analysis when the attention was calmly bent.</p>

<p>I kept my lofty perch for hours, frequently closing my eyes to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the music by itself, or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that
was streaming past. The fragrance of the woods was less marked
than that produced during warm rain, when so many balsamic buds
and leaves are steeped like tea; but, from the chafing of resiny branches
against each other, and the incessant attrition of myriads of needles,
the gale was spiced to a very tonic degree. And besides the fragrance
from these local sources there were traces of scents brought from
afar. For this wind came first from the sea, rubbing against its fresh,
briny waves, then distilled through the redwoods, threading rich ferny
gulches, and spreading itself in broad, undulating currents over many
a flower-enameled ridge of the Coast Mountains, then across the
golden plains, up the purple foothills, and into these piny woods with
the varied incense gathered by the way.</p>

<p>When the storm began to abate, I dismounted and sauntered down
through the calming woods. The storm-tones died away, and, turning
toward the east, I beheld the countless hosts of the forests hushed
and tranquil, towering above one another on the slopes of the hills
like a devout audience. The setting sun filled them with amber light,
and seemed to say, while they listened, “My peace I give unto you.”</p>

<p>As I gazed on the impressive scene, all the so-called ruin of the
storm was forgotten, and never before did these noble woods appear
so fresh, so joyous, so immortal.—From “The Mountains of California.”

<h5>AN UNEXPECTED ADVENTURE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Muir</span></p>

<p>A wild scene, but not a safe one, is made by the moon as it appears
through the edge of the Yosemite Fall when one is behind it. Once,
after enjoying the night-song of the waters and watching the formation
of the colored bow as the moon came round the domes and sent
her beams into the wild uproar, I ventured out on the narrow bench
that extends back of the fall from Fern Ledge and began to admire
the dim-veiled grandeur of the view. I could see the fine, gauzy
threads of the fall’s filmy border by having the light in front; and
wishing to look at the moon through the meshes of some of the denser
portions of the fall, I ventured to creep further behind it while it was
gently wind-swayed, without taking sufficient thought about the consequences
of its swaying back to its natural position after the wind-pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
should be removed. The effect was enchanting: fine, savage
music sounding above, beneath, around me; while the moon, apparently
in the very midst of the rushing waters, seemed to be struggling to
keep her place, on account of the ever-varying form and density of
the water-masses through which she was seen, now darkly veiled or
eclipsed by a rush of thick-headed comets, now flashing out through
openings between their tails. I was in fairyland between the dark
wall and the wild throng of illumined waters, but suffered sudden disenchantment;
for, like the witch-scene in Alloway Kirk, “in an instant
all was dark.” Down came a dash of spent comets, thin and
harmless-looking in the distance, but they felt desperately solid and
stony when they struck my shoulders, like a mixture of choking spray
and gravel and big hailstones. Instinctively dropping on my knees, I
gripped an angle of the rock, curled up like a young fern frond with
my face pressed against my breast, and in this attitude submitted as
best I could to my thundering bath. The heavier masses seemed to
strike like cobblestones, and there was a confused noise of many
waters about my ears—hissing, gurgling, clashing sounds that were
not heard as music. The situation was quickly realized. How fast
one’s thoughts burn in such times of stress! I was weighing chances
of escape. Would the column be swayed a few inches away from the
wall, or would it come yet closer? The fall was in flood and not so
lightly would its ponderous mass be swayed. My fate seemed to depend
on a breath of the “idle wind.” It was moved gently forward,
the pounding ceased, and I was once more visited by glimpses of the
moon. But fearing I might be caught at a disadvantage in making
too hasty a retreat, I moved only a few feet along the bench to where
a block of ice lay. I wedged myself between the ice and the wall,
and lay face downwards, until the steadiness of the light gave encouragement
to rise and get away. Somewhat nerve-shaken, drenched,
and benumbed, I made out to build a fire, warmed myself, ran home,
reached my cabin before daylight, got an hour or two of sleep, and
awoke sound and comfortable, better, not worse, for my hard midnight
bath.—From “The Yosemite.” Copyright by <i>The Century Co.</i>, New

<h5>THE TORTURE OF THE STRAIT-JACKET</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Jack London</span></p>

<p>Have you ever seen canvas tarpaulins or rubber blankets with brass
eyelets set in along the edges? Then imagine a piece of stout canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
some four and one-half feet in length, with large and heavy brass
eyelets running down both edges. The width of this canvas is never
the full girth of the human body it is to surround. The width is also
irregular—broadest at the shoulders, next broadest at the hips, and
narrowest at the waist.</p>

<p>The jacket is spread on the floor. The man who is to be punished,
or who is to be tortured for confession, is told to lie face-downward
on the flat canvas. If he refuses, he is man-handled. After that he
lays himself down with a will, which is the will of the hang-dogs,
which is your will, dear citizen, who feeds and fees the hang-dogs
for doing this thing for you.</p>

<p>The man lies face-downward. The edges of the jacket are brought
as nearly together as possible along the center of the man’s back.
Then a rope, on the principle of a shoe-lace, is run through the eyelets,
and on the principle of shoe-lacing the man is laced in the canvas.
Only he is laced more severely than any person ever laces his shoe.
They call it “cinching” in prison lingo. On occasion, when the guards
are cruel and vindictive or when the command has come down from
above, in order to insure the severity of the lacing the guards press
with their feet into the man’s back as they draw the lacing tight.</p>

<p>Have you ever laced your shoe too tightly, and, after half an hour
experienced that excruciating pain across the instep of the obstructed
circulation? And do you remember that after a few minutes of such
pain you simply could not walk another step and had to untie the shoe-lace
and ease the pressure? Very well. Then try to imagine your
whole body so laced, only much more tightly, and that the squeeze,
instead of being merely on the instep of one foot, is on your entire
trunk, compressing to the seeming of death your heart, your lungs,
and all the rest of your vital and essential organs.</p>

<p>I remember the first time they gave me the jacket down in the
dungeons. It was at the beginning of my incorrigibility, shortly after
my entrance to prison, when I was weaving my loom-task of a hundred
yards a day in the jute mill and finishing two hours ahead of the
average day. Yes, and my jute-sacking was far above the average
demanded. I was sent to the jacket that first time, according to the
prison books, because of “skips” and “breaks” in the cloth, in short,
because my work was defective. Of course this was ridiculous. In
truth, I was sent to the jacket because I, a new convict, a master of
efficiency, a trained expert in the elimination of waste motion, had
elected to tell the stupid head-weaver a few things he did not know
about his business. And the head-weaver, with Captain Jamie present,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
had me called to the table where atrocious weaving, such as could
never have gone through my loom, was exhibited against me. Three
times was I thus called to the table. The third calling meant punishment
according to the loom-room rules. My punishment was twenty-four
hours in the jacket.</p>

<p>They took me down into the dungeon. I was ordered to lie face-downward
on the canvas spread flat upon the floor. I refused. One
of the guards, Morrison, gulleted me with his thumbs. Mobins, the
dungeon trusty, a convict himself, struck me repeatedly with his fists.
In the end I lay down as directed. And, because of the struggle I had
vexed them with, they laced me extra tight. Then they rolled me over
like a log upon my back.</p>

<p>It did not seem so bad at first. When they closed my door, with a
clang and clash of levered boltage, and left me in the utter dark, it
was eleven o’clock in the morning. For a few minutes I was aware
merely of an uncomfortable constriction which I fondly believed would
ease as I grew accustomed to it. On the contrary, my heart began to
thump and my lungs seemed unable to draw sufficient air for my
blood. This sense of suffocation was terrorizing, and every thump of
the heart threatened to burst my already bursting lungs.</p>

<p>After what seemed hours, and after what, out of my countless succeeding
experiences in that jacket I can now fairly conclude to have
been not more than half an hour, I began to cry out, to yell, to
scream, to howl, in a very madness of dying. The trouble was the
pain that had arisen in my heart. It was a sharp, definite pain, similar
to that of pleurisy, except that it stabbed hotly through the heart
itself.</p>

<p>To die is not a difficult thing, but to die in such slow and horrible
fashion was maddening. Like a trapped beast of the wild, I experienced
ecstasies of fear, and yelled and howled until I realized that such
vocal exercise merely stabbed my heart more hotly and at the same
time consumed much of the little air in my lungs.</p>

<p>I gave over and lay quiet for a long time—an eternity it seemed
then though now I am confident that it could have been no longer
than a quarter of an hour. I grew dizzy with semi-asphyxiation, and
my heart thumped until it seemed surely it would burst the canvas
that bound me. Again I lost control of myself and set up a mad
howling for help.</p>

<p>In the midst of this I heard a voice from the next dungeon.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” it shouted, though only faintly it percolated to me.
“Shut up. You make me tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“I’m dying,” I cried out.</p>

<p>“Pound your ear and forget it,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But I am dying,” I insisted.</p>

<p>“Then why worry?” came the voice. “You’ll be dead pretty quick
an’ out of it. Go ahead and croak, but don’t make so much noise
about it. You’re interruptin’ my beauty sleep.”</p>

<p>So angered was I by this callous indifference, that I recovered self-control
and was guilty of no more than smothered groans.—From “The

<h5>A SON OF COPPER SIN</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Herman Whitaker</span></p>

<p>Within his bull’s-hide tepee, old Iz-le-roy lay and fed his little fire,
stick by stick. He was sick, very sick—sick with the sickness which
is made up of equal parts of hunger, old age, fever and despair. Just
one week before his tribe had headed up for Winnipegoos, where the
whitefish may be had for the taking and the moose winter in their
yards. But a sick man may not travel the long trail, so Iz-le-roy had
remained at White Man’s Lake. And Batiste, his son, stayed also.
Not that it was expected of him, for, according to forest law, the man
who cannot hunt had better die; but Batiste had talked with the
gentle priest of Ellice, and had chosen to depart from the custom of
his fathers.</p>

<p>And things had gone badly, very badly, since the tribe had marched.
North, south, east and west, the round of the plains, and through the
leafless woods, the boy had hunted without as much as a jack-rabbit
falling to his gun. For two days no food had passed their lips, and
now he was gone forth to do that which Iz-le-roy had almost rather
die than have him do—ask aid of the settlers.</p>

<p>“Yea, my son,” the old warrior had faltered, “these be they that
stole the prairies of our fathers. Yet it may be that Big Laugh, best
of an evil brood, will give us of his store of flour and bacon.”</p>

<p>So, after placing a plentiful stock of wood close to the old man’s
hand, Batiste had closed the tepee flap and laced it. At the end of an
hour’s fast walking, during which the northern sky grew dark with
the threat of still more cruel weather, he sighted through the drift
a spurting column of smoke.</p>

<p>The smoke marked the cabin of John Sterling, and also his present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
occupation. Within, John sat and fired the stove, while Avis, his
daughter, set out the breakfast dishes, and his wife turned the sizzling
bacon in the pan.</p>

<p>“I declare,” exclaimed the woman, pausing, knife in hand, “if that
bread ain’t froze solid!”</p>

<p>“Cold last night,” commented Sterling. “Put it in the oven, Mary.”</p>

<p>As she stooped to obey, the door quietly opened and Batiste slipped
in. His moose moccasins made no noise, and he was standing close
beside her when she straightened. She jumped and gasped:</p>

<p>“Lor’ ’a’ mercy! How you do scare one! Why don’t you knock?”</p>

<p>Batiste stared. It was the custom of his tribe thus to enter a house,
a custom established before jails were built or locks invented. His
eye therefore roamed questioningly from one to another until Sterling
asked:</p>

<p>“What d’ye want, young fellow?”</p>

<p>Batiste pointed to the frying pan. “Bakin!” he muttered. “The
bakin of Big Laugh, I want. Iz-le-roy sick, plenty sick. Him want
flour, him want ba-kin.”</p>

<p>The thought of his father’s need flashed into his mind, and realizing
the impossibility of expressing himself in English, he broke into a
voluble stream of Cree, punctuating its rolling gutturals with energetic
signs. While he was speaking, Avis ceased rattling her dishes.</p>

<p>“He looks awfully hungry, dad,” she whispered, as Batiste finished.</p>

<p>Now, though Sterling was a large-souled, generous man, and jovial—as
evidenced by his name of Big Laugh—it happened that, during
the past summer, a roving band of Sioux had camped hard by and
begged him out of patience. That morning, too, the threatening
weather had spoiled an intended trip to Russel and touched his temper—of
which he had a goodly share.</p>

<p>“Can’t help it, girl,” he snapped. “If we feed every hungry Injun
that comes along, we’ll soon be out of house and home. Can’t do
anything for you, boy.”</p>

<p>“Him want ba-kin,” Batiste said.</p>

<p>“Well, you can just want.”</p>

<p>“Iz-le-roy sick, him want ba-kin,” the boy pleaded.</p>

<p>His persistence irritated Sterling, and, crowding down the better
feeling which spoke for the lad, he sprang up, threw wide the door,
and shouted:</p>

<p>“Get, you son of copper sin! Get, now! Quick!”</p>

<p>“Father!” pleaded the girl.</p>

<p>But he took no heed, and held wide the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>Into Batiste’s face flashed surprise, anger and resentment. Surprise,
because he had not believed all the things Iz-le-roy had told him of
the white men, but had preferred to think them all like Father Francis.
But now? His father was right. They were all cold and merciless,
their hearts hard as their steel ax-heads, their tongues sharp as the
cutting edge. With head held high he marched through the door,
away from the hot stove, the steaming coffee, and the delicious smell
of frying bacon, out into the cold storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” remonstrated his wife, as Sterling closed the door.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mary,” he answered testily, “we fed a whole tribe last
summer, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“But this lad don’t belong to them,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“All the worse,” he rejoined. “Do an Injun a good turn an’ he
never forgets. Give him his breakfast, an’ he totes his tribe along
to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed the good woman, “I’m real sorry.”</p>

<p>For a few moments both were silent. And presently, as the man’s
kindly nature began to triumph over his irritation, he hitched uneasily
in his chair. Already he felt ashamed. Casting a sheepish glance at
his wife, he rose, walked to the door, and looked out. But a wall
of whirling white blocked his vision. Batiste was gone beyond recall.</p>

<p>“Where’s Avis?” he asked, returning to the stove.</p>

<p>“A-vis!” called her mother.</p>

<p>But there was no answer. For a moment man and wife stared
each other in the eye; then, moved by a common impulse, they walked
into the kitchen. There, on the table, lay the half of a fresh-cut side
of bacon; the bread-box was open and a crusty loaf missing; the girl’s
shawl was gone from its peg and her overshoes from their corner.</p>

<p>“Good God!” gasped the settler. “The child’s gone after him!”</p>

<p>They knew the risk. All the morning the storm had been brewing,
and now it thundered by, a veritable blizzard. The blizzard! King of
storms! It compels the settler to string a wire from house to stables,
it sets men to circling in the snow, it catches little children coming
home from school and buries them in its monstrous drifts.</p>

<p>Without another word Sterling wound a scarf about his neck, grabbed
his badger mitts, and rushed outside.</p>

<p>When Avis softly closed the kitchen door she could just see Batiste
rounding a bluff that lay a furlong west of her father’s stables. She
started after him; but by the time she had covered half the distance a
sea of white swept in between and blotted him from view.</p>

<p>She struggled on, and on, and still on, until, in spite of the seventy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
degrees of frost, the perspiration burst from every pore and the scud
melted on her glowing face. This was well enough—so long as she
kept moving; but when the time came that she must stop, she would
freeze all the quicker for her present warmth.</p>

<p>This, being born and bred of the prairie, Avis knew, and the knowledge
kept her toiling, toiling on, until her tired legs and leaden feet
compelled a pause in the shelter of a bluff. She was hungry, too.
All this time she carried the bread and meat, and now, unconscious
of a pair of slant eyes which glared from a willow thicket, she broke
the loaf and began to eat. While she ate, the green lights in the eyes
flared brighter, a long red tongue licked the drool from grinning jaws,
and forth from his covert stole a lank, gray wolf.</p>

<p>Avis uttered a startled cry. This was no coyote, to be chased with
a stick, but a wolf of timber stock, a great beast, heavy, prick-eared,
strong as a mastiff. His nose puckered in a wicked snarl as he slunk
in half-circles across her front. He was undecided. So, while he
circled, trying to make up his mind, drawing a little nearer at every
turn, Avis fell back—back towards the bluff, keeping her white face
always to the creeping beast.</p>

<p>It was a small bluff, lacking a tree large enough to climb, but sufficient
for her purpose. On its edge she paused, threw the bacon to
the wolf, and then ran desperately. Once clear of the scrub, she ran
on, plunging through drifts, stumbling, falling, to rise again and push
her flight. Of direction she took no heed; her only thought was to
place distance between herself and the red-mouthed brute. But when,
weary and breathless, she paused for rest, out of the drab drift stole
the lank, gray shadow.</p>

<p>The brute crouched a few yards away, licking his sinful lips, winking
his devil eyes. She still had the loaf. As she threw it, the wolf
sprang and snapped it in mid-air. Then she ran, and ran, and ran,
as the tired doe runs from the hounds. For what seemed to her an
interminable time, though it was less than five minutes, she held on;
then stopped, spent, unable to take another step. Looking back, she
saw nothing of the wolf; but just when she began to move slowly
forward, thinking he had given up the chase, a gray shape loomed
right ahead.</p>

<p>Uttering a bitter cry, she turned once more, tottered a few steps,
and fainted.</p>

<p>As, wildly calling his daughter’s name, Sterling rushed by his stables,
the wind smote him with tremendous power. Like a living thing it
buffeted him about the ears, tore at his breath, poured over him an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
avalanche of snow. Still he pressed on and gained the bluff which
Avis missed.</p>

<p>As he paused to draw a free breath, his eye picked out a fresh-made
track. Full of a sudden hope, he shouted. A voice answered, and as
he rushed eagerly forward a dark figure came through the drift to
meet him. It was Batiste.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sterling was cruelly disappointed, but he answered quickly: “You
see my girl? Yes, my girl,” he repeated, noting the lad’s look of
wonder. “Young white squaw, you see um?”</p>

<p>“Mooniah papoose?” queried Batiste.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! She follow you. Want give you bread, want give you
bacon. All gone, all lost!” Sterling finished with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>“Squaw marche to me? Ba-kin for me?” questioned Batiste.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried Sterling, in a flurry of impatience.</p>

<p>“I find um,” he said, softly.</p>

<p>Briefly Batiste laid down his plan, eking out his scanty English with
vivid signs. In snow, the white man rolls along like a clumsy buffalo,
planting his feet far out to the right and left. And because his right
leg steps a little further than the left, he always, when lost, travels in
a circle. Wherefore Batiste indicated that they should move along
parallel lines, just shouting distance apart, so as to cover the largest
possible ground.</p>

<p>“Young squaw marche slow. She there!” He pointed north and
east with a gesture. “Yes, there!”</p>

<p>Batiste paused until Sterling got his distance; then, keeping the
wind slanting to his left cheek, he moved off north and east. Ever
and anon he stopped to give forth a piercing yell. If Sterling answered,
he moved on; if not—as happened twice—he traveled in his
direction until they were once more in touch. And so, shouting and
yelling, they bore off north and east for a long half-hour.</p>

<p>After that, Batiste began to throw his cries both east and west, for
he judged that they must be closing on the girl. And suddenly, from
the north, came a weird, tremulous answer. He started, and throwing
up his head, emitted the wolf’s long howl. Leaning forward, he
waited—his very soul in his ears—until, shrill yet deep-chested and
quivering with ferocity, came back the answering howl.</p>

<p>No coyote gave forth that cry, and Batiste knew it.</p>

<p>“Timber wolf!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Turning due north, he gave the settler a warning yell, then sped
like a hunted deer in the direction of the cry. He ran with the long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
lithe lope which tires down even the swift elk, and in five minutes
covered nearly a mile. Once more he gave forth the wolf howl. An
answer came close by, but as he sprang forward it ended with a
frightened yelp. Through a break in the drift he spied a moving
figure; then a swirl swept in and blotted it from view.</p>

<p>But he had seen the girl. A dozen leaps and he was close upon her.
Just as he opened his mouth to speak, she screamed and plunged
headlong.</p>

<p>When consciousness returned, Avis was lying on her own bed. Her
mother bent over her; Sterling stood near by. All around were the
familiar things of life, but her mind still retained a vivid picture of
her flight, and she sprang up screaming:</p>

<p>“The wolf; oh, the wolf!”</p>

<p>“Hush, dearie,” her mother soothed. “It wasn’t a wolf, but just
the Cree boy.”</p>

<p>Batiste had told how she screamed at the sight of his gray, snow-covered
blanket, and the cry had carried even to her father. But
when she recovered sufficiently to tell her story, the father shuddered
and the mother exclaimed:</p>

<p>“John, we owe that boy more than we can ever pay!”</p>

<p>“We do!” he fervently agreed.</p>

<p>Just then the latch of the other door clicked, and a cold blast
streamed into the bedroom. Jumping up, the mother cried:</p>

<p>“Run, John; he’s going!”</p>

<p>“Here, young fellow!” shouted the settler.</p>

<p>Batiste paused in the doorway, his hand on the latch, his slight body
silhouetted against the white of the storm.</p>

<p>“Where you going, boy?”</p>

<p>“To Iz-le-roy,” he answered. “Him sick. Bezhou!”</p>

<p>Sterling strode forward and caught him by the shoulder. “No, you
don’t,” he said, “not that way.” Then, turning, he called into the
bedroom: “Here, mother! Get out all your wraps while I hitch the
ponies. And fix up our best bed for a sick man.”—From “The Probationer,”

<h5>SOMBRE<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By William Wetmore Story</span></p>

<p>Long golden beams from the setting sun swept over the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Andalusia, and fell upon the Geralda tower of the great cathedral of
Sevilla, many miles in the distance. In their path they illumined a
stretch of vast pastures enclosed by whitened stone walls, and dotted
with magnificent cattle. In a far corner of one of the enclosures the
figure of a young girl passed through an arched stone gateway. As
she paused to look upon the scattered groups of grazing beasts, the
level rays played in lights and shadows upon the waving masses
of dark chestnut hair, richly health-tinted young face, creamy neck,
and large, lustrous eyes now painfully dry, as if tears were exhausted.
She gazed from group to group, calling eagerly, “Sombre!
Sombre!”</p>

<p>A pair of long, gleaming horns rose abruptly amid the browsing
herd, and a magnificent bull came towards her at a brisk trot. The
sunbeams glinted upon his dark coat as it swelled and sank under
the play of powerful muscles. His neck and shoulders were leonine
in massive strength, the legs and hind-quarters as sleek and symmetrical
as those of a race-horse, but his ferociousness was held in
check by that devoted love dumb animals express for those who love
them.</p>

<p>In a moment the young girl’s white arms were thrown around the
animal’s dusky neck, and her cheek was lain against the silken skin.
“Oh, Sombre!” she murmured, “do you know what they are going
to do with you? Papa wants to send you to the Plaza de Toros! I
have begged him in vain to spare you. Does he think after Anita
has brought you from a tiny calf to be such a beautiful, dear toro
that she can give you to the cruel matador to be tortured, made crazy
and killed?”</p>

<p>She was sobbing bitterly, and the devoted beast was striving vainly
to turn his head far enough to lick the fair neck bending down
upon his. Presently the sobbing ceased, and she stroked the strong
shoulders with her small hand.</p>

<p>“Never fear, Sombre, if they take you to Sevilla Anita will find a
way to save you! Now, say good night.”</p>

<p>Sombre thrust out his huge tongue and licked the little hand and
arms. Then she bent forward and kissed him on the frowning, furry
forehead and departed.</p>

<p>Anita’s path homeward lay through another field where a herd of
cattle were being driven. A young herdsman, riding a strong horse
at a brisk canter, saw the young girl enter from the adjoining pasture.
With joyful exclamation in English he rode towards her calling,
“Anita, have you seen the posters?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>Waiting until he reached her side, with bated breath she asked,
“Is—is Sombre advertised?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on the outer gateway. But here, I have a poster in my
pocket.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Plaza de Toros de Sevilla<br>
May 17.<br>
Anniversary of the King’s Birthday,<br>
Six Bulls to be killed,<br>
The two magnificent brother bulls<br>
Sol and Sombre,<br>
and others very ferocious,<br>
against<br>
The intrepid Matadores,<br>
Lariato, the American, and<br>
Amador, of Sevilla.</i></p>

<p>“It is cruel of them, cruel! (Reading) ‘Lariato, the American.’
Why, that is yourself! You will spare him! You will spare my
Sombre!”</p>

<p>“They do not permit me to fight Don Alonzo’s bulls, for I raise
them and they would not fight me. Amador will fight Sombre.”</p>

<p>“No, no! You must fight Sombre. That wicked Amador will kill
him!”</p>

<p>“But so would I, Anita, or be killed by him!”</p>

<p>Anita was silent for a time; suddenly she exclaimed: “Orlando,
do you love me well enough to put faith in a promise which will seem
impossible of fulfillment?”</p>

<p>“God knows I do!”</p>

<p>“Then listen; if Sombre goes to the Plaza de Toros, you must fight
him and spare him even though they hiss and jeer at you.”</p>

<p>“Death is easier. Perhaps the managers will let me fight him, for
you have raised him, and I can tell them that I have scarcely seen
him. I will fight him, Anita, and for your sake I will let him kill me!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Orlando, for this is my promise, even in the last extremity
Sombre shall not harm you!”</p>

<p>“And then, Anita!”</p>

<p>“Then I will leave my father’s house and go with you. We will
buy Sombre and go to those plains in your country you love so to
tell about. You will become a ranch hero, and Sombre shall be the
patriarch of our herd!”</p>

<p>“I have tried that once and failed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, but you had neither Sombre nor Anita then!” And waving him
a kiss she ran off across the field.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May, in the Plaza de Toros, there was a murmur
from thousands of throats like the magnified hum of bees. Amador
of Sevilla had killed several bulls and now there was a short intermission.
In a stall of the lowest tier sat Anita alone. Presently a
band of music began a stately march, and under a high stone archway
a long procession advanced. First, gaudily caparisoned picadors
on blindfolded studs, two by two, separated and came to a halt, facing
the center, with long lances abreast. Then red-coated toreadors carrying
long barbs, with brilliant streamers of ribbon, grouped themselves
near the heavy closed doors of the bull-pen; finally, the capeadors in
yellow satin, carrying flaming red capes on their arms, filed around
like the mounted picadors and stood between their studs.</p>

<p>The music ceased, the murmur of voices died away, and the gates
of the bull-pen were thrown open. At a quick trot, a great black bull
dashed in, receiving in his shoulders as he passed the toreador’s two
short barbs. Anita gripped her chair and gasped, “Sombre!”</p>

<p>Coming from a darkened pen, Sombre had trotted eagerly forward,
expecting to find himself once more in his loved pastures, but he
paused, bewildered in the glare of light. Hither and thither he turned
in nervous abruptness, his head raised high, his tail slowly lashing
his flanks. Then he lowered his grand head and sniffed the earth,
and then he smelled fresh, warm blood, the blood of his own kind.
With gathering rage he lowered his keen horns close to the ground
and gave a deep, hoarse bellow of defiance, flinging clod after clod
with his forefeet high above his back. Then there flaunted toward
him a red object at which he charged, but it swept aside, and a new
sting of pain was felt in his neck, and warm blood was trickling over
his glossy skin. Again and again he charged, but each time the red
thing vanished and there was more pain, more torturing barbs that
maddened him.</p>

<p>Presently a horseman advanced with lowered spear. Surely horse
and rider could not vanish. Ah, no! Sombre found that it was not
intended that they should. Rushing upon them he struck them with
such a blow that they were forced backwards twenty feet and both
gave a scream of pain. The picador was dragged away with a broken
leg, and the horse lay lifeless, for Sombre’s horn had pierced its
heart. Instantly a great cry went up from that crater of humanity,
“Bravo! Bravo, Toro! Bravo, Sombre!”</p>

<p>More than once he earned that grand applause, then his tormentors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
disappeared and through one of the archways advanced a young man
tall and athletic. On his left arm hung a scarlet mantle, and in his
right hand he carried a long, keen sword. Passing under the archway,
the matador swept his sword in military salute, then with lowered
point he stepped into the arena and faced his antagonist. Upon all fell
an awful silence, for Lariato and Sombre were met in a struggle to
the death!</p>

<p>For a time the combatants stood motionless, eyeing each other intently.
Then came stealthy movements, hither and thither, then
thundering, desperate charges, and graceful, hair-breadth escapes. At
last in one great charge, Sombre’s horn tore the mantle from Lariato’s
arm and carrying it half around the ring, as a flaming banner, the
bull ground and trampled it in the dust. A slight hissing was heard
in the audience which turned to thundering applause when Lariato
contemptuously refused a new mantle! The audience became breathless,
the man alone was now the mad beast’s target!</p>

<p>Sombre, dripping with blood and perspiration, his flanks swelling
and falling in his great gasps for breath, his eyes half blinded by the
dust and glare of the arena, gave the matador one brief glance, then
with head low down, charged upon him. Lariato’s long keen blade
was lowered confidently to its death-dealing slant.</p>

<p>Just as the murderous sword-point seemed about to sink through
the bull’s shoulders, into his very heart, a despairing woman’s cry
reached the matador’s ears. Then a mighty hiss, interspersed with
hoots and jeers, went up from the exasperated spectators, for the bull
thundered on, with the sword scarcely penetrating the tough muscles,
standing upright between his shoulders, while Lariato stood disarmed.</p>

<p>Coming to a standstill far beyond his antagonist, Sombre shook
his huge neck and the sword spun high into the air and fell toward
the center of the ring. Lariato took several steps toward it, but
tottered and fell upon the ground in a swoon, for he had been severely
bruised.</p>

<p>With an exultant roar, the bull rushed back to complete his victory;
the hissing and the hooting was hushed, and groans of horror filled
the air. Suddenly, just as the animal had gained full headway in his
murderous charge, a slight, white figure glided into the ring, and a
clear voice cried “Sombre!”</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice, the charging beast came strainingly to
a halt, threw up his head, and gazed eagerly about, then turned and
rushed toward the girl! Capeadors hurried forward flaunting their
red capes, but she waved them back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“Go back! You shall torment him no more, my poor, tortured,
wounded Sombre!”</p>

<p>In a moment the great beast was beside her, licking her dress and
arms and hands. As she deftly extricated the barbs from his neck and
shoulders, the thousands of throats around them shrieked out a vast
pandemonium of bravos. Blood was covering her hands and staining
her dress, but Anita was blind to it. Meanwhile Lariato had struggled
to his feet and hurried towards her. “God bless you,” he was saying,
but she pushed past him with a glad smile, saying, “Wait, I have
something to say to them!”</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of the ring, Anita waited for silence. Delaying
until not a sound was heard, she said in a clear voice that
reached every ear:</p>

<p>“Jeer not at Lariato; he spared my pet, my Sombre, because he loved
me.”</p>

<p>No matador ever gained such applause as followed. Bouquets,
sombreros, scarfs, and full purses showered into the ring, and as that
strange group stood facing the ovation, “Bravo, Lariato, Bravo, la
Señorita de Toros, Bravo, Sombre!” rang out and reëchoed over the
distant housetops.</p>

<h5>A COMBAT IN THE ARENA</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By George Croly</span></p>

<p>A portal of the arena opened, and the combatant, with a mantle
thrown over his face and figure, was led into the surroundery. The
lion roared and ramped against the bars of his den at the sight. The
guard put a sword and buckler into the hands of the Christian, and he
was left alone. He drew the mantle from his face, and bent a slow
and firm look around the amphitheater. His fine countenance and lofty
bearing raised a universal shout of admiration. He might have stood
for an Apollo encountering the Python. His eyes at last turned on
mine. Could I believe my senses? Constantius was before me.</p>

<p>All my rancour vanished. An hour past, I could have struck the
betrayer of the heart—I could have called on the severest vengeance
of man and heaven to smite the destroyer of my child. But to see
him hopelessly doomed, the man whom I had honored for his noble
qualities, whom I had even loved, whose crime was, at the worst, but
the crime of giving way to the strongest temptation that can bewilder
the heart of man; to see the noble creature flung to the savage beast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
dying in tortures, torn piecemeal before my eyes, and his misery
wrought by me, I would have supplicated earth and heaven to save
him. But my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth. My limbs
refused to stir. I would have thrown myself at the feet of Nero;
but I sat like a man of stone—pale—paralyzed—the beating of my
pulse stopped—my eyes alone alive.</p>

<p>The gate of the den was thrown back, and the lion rushed in with
a roar and a bound that bore him half across the arena. I saw the
sword glitter in the air; when it waved again, it was covered with
blood. A howl told that the blow had been driven home. The lion,
one of the largest of Numidia, and made furious by thirst and hunger,
an animal of prodigious power, crouched for an instant, as if to make
sure of his prey, crept a few paces onward, and sprang at the victim’s
throat. He was met by a second wound, but his impulse was irresistible.
A cry of natural horror rang round the amphitheater. The
struggle was now for an instant, life or death. They rolled over each
other; the lion, reared upon his hind feet with gnashing teeth and
distended talons, plunged on the man; again they rose together.
Anxiety was now at its wildest height. The sword now swung round
the Christian’s head in bloody circles. They fell again, covered with
blood and dust. The hand of Constantius had grasped the lion’s mane,
and the furious bounds of the monster could not lose his hold; but
his strength was evidently giving way—he still struck his terrible
blows, but each was weaker than the one before; till, collecting his
whole force for a last effort, he darted one mighty blow into the
lion’s throat and sank. The savage beast yelled, and spouting out
blood, fled howling around the arena. But the hand still grasped the
mane, and the conqueror was dragged whirling through the dust at
his heels. A universal outcry now arose to save him, if he were not
already dead. But the lion, though bleeding from every vein, was
still too terrible, and all shrank from the hazard. At last, the grasp
gave way, and the body lay motionless on the ground.</p>

<p>What happened for some moments after, I know not. There was
a struggle at the portal; a female forced her way through the guards,
rushed in alone, and flung herself upon the victim. The sight of a
new prey roused the lion; he tore the ground with his talons; he
lashed his streaming sides with his tail; he lifted up his mane and
bared his fangs. But his approaching was no longer with a bound;
he dreaded the sword, and came sniffing the blood on the sand, and
stealing round the body in circuits still diminishing.</p>

<p>The confusion in the vast assemblage was now extreme. Voices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
innumerable called for aid. Women screamed and fainted, men burst
into indignant clamors at this prolonged cruelty. Even the hard hearts
of the populace, accustomed as they were to the sacrifice of life, were
roused to honest curses. The guards grasped their arms, and waited
but for a sign from the emperor. But Nero gave no sign.</p>

<p>I looked upon the woman’s face; it was Salome! I sprang upon my
feet. I called on her name; called on her, by every feeling of nature,
to fly from that place of death, to come to my arms, to think of the
agonies of all that loved her.</p>

<p>She had raised the head of Constantius on her knee, and was wiping
the pale visage with her hair. At the sound of my voice, she looked
up, and, calmly casting back the locks from her forehead, fixed her
eyes upon me. She still knelt; one hand supported the head—with
the other she pointed to it as her only answer. I again adjured her.
There was the silence of death among the thousands around me. A
fire dashed into her eye—her cheek burned—she waved her hand with
an air of superb sorrow.</p>

<p>“I am come to die,” she uttered, in a lofty tone. “This bleeding
body was my husband—I have no father. The world contains to me
but this clay in my arms. Yet,” and she kissed the ashy lips before
her, “yet, my Constantius, it was to save that father that your generous
heart defied the peril of this hour. It was to redeem him from the
hand of evil that you abandoned your quiet home!—Yes, cruel father,
here lies the noble being that threw open your dungeon, that led you
safe through the conflagration, that, to the last moment of his liberty,
only sought how he might preserve and protect you.” Tears at length
fell in floods from her eyes. “But,” said she, in tones of wild power,
“he was betrayed, and may the Power whose thunders avenge the
cause of his people, pour down just retribution upon the head that
dared—”</p>

<p>I heard my own condemnation about to be pronounced by the lips
of my own child. Wound up to the last degree of suffering, I tore my
hair, leaped upon the bars before me, and plunged into the arena by
her side. The height stunned me; I tottered a few paces and fell.
The lion gave a roar and sprang upon me. I lay helpless under him,
I heard the gnashing of his white fangs above me.</p>

<p>An exulting shout arose. I saw him reel as if struck—gore filled
his jaws. Another mighty blow was driven to his heart. He sprang
high in the air with a howl. He dropped; he was dead. The amphitheater
thundered with acclamations.</p>

<p>With Salome clinging to my bosom, Constantius raised me from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
the ground—the roar of the lion had roused him from his swoon,
and two blows saved me. The falchion had broken in the heart of
the monster.</p>

<p>The whole multitude stood up, supplicating for our lives in the name
of filial piety and heroism. Nero, devil as he was, dared not resist the
strength of popular feeling. He waved a signal to the guards; the
portal was opened, and my children, sustaining my feeble steps,
showered with garlands and ornaments from innumerable hands, slowly
led me from the arena.</p>

<h5>KAWEAH’S RUN</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Clarence King</span></p>

<p>As I walked over to see Kaweah at the corral, I glanced down the
river, and saw, perhaps a quarter of a mile below, two horsemen ride
down our bank, spur their horses into the stream, swim to the other
side, and struggle up a steep bank, disappearing among bunches of
cottonwood trees near the river.</p>

<p>They were Spaniards—the same who had swum King’s River the
afternoon before, and, as it flashed on me finally, the two whom I
had studied so attentively at Visalia. Then I at once saw their purpose
was to waylay me, and made up my mind to give them a lively
run.</p>

<p>I decided to strike across, and jumping into the saddle threw
Kaweah into a sharp trot.</p>

<p>I glanced at my girth and then at the bright copper upon my pistol,
and settled myself firmly.</p>

<p>By this time I had regained the road, which lay before me traced
over the blank, objectless plain in vanishing perspective. Fifteen miles
lay between me and a station; Kaweah and pistol were my only defense,
yet at that moment I felt a thrill of pleasure, a wild moment
of inspiration, almost worth the danger to experience.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder and found that the Spaniards were
crowding their horses to their fullest speed; their hoofs, rattling on
the dry plain, were accompanied by inarticulate noises, like the cries
of bloodhounds. Kaweah comprehended the situation. I could feel
his grand legs gather under me, and the iron muscles contract with
excitement; he tugged at the bit, shook his bridle-chains, and flung
himself impatiently into the air.</p>

<p>It flashed upon me that perhaps they had confederates concealed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
some ditch far in advance of me, and that the plan was to crowd me
through at fullest speed, giving up the chase to new men and fresh
horses; and I resolved to save Kaweah to the utmost, and only allow
him a speed which should keep me out of gunshot. So I held him
firmly, and reserved my spur for the last emergency. Still we fairly
flew over the plain, and I said to myself, as the clatter of hoofs and
din of my pursuers rang in my ears now and then, as the freshening
breeze hurried it forward, that, if those brutes got me, there was
nothing in blood and brains; for Kaweah was a prince beside their
mustangs, and I ought to be worth two villains.</p>

<p>For the first twenty minutes the road was hard and smooth and
level; after that gentle, shallow undulations began, and at last, at
brief intervals, were sharp, narrow arroyos (ditches eight or nine feet
wide). I reined Kaweah in, and brought him up sharply on their
bottoms, giving him the bit to spring up on the other side; but he
quickly taught me better, and, gathering, took them easily, without my
feeling it in his stride.</p>

<p>The hot sun had arisen. I saw with anxiety that the tremendous
speed began to tell painfully on Kaweah. Foam tinged with blood
fell from his mouth, and sweat rolled in streams from his whole body,
and now and then he drew a deep-heaving breath. I leaned down
and felt of the cinch to see if it had slipped forward, but, as I had
saddled him with great care, it kept its true place, so I had only to
fear the greasers behind, or a new relay ahead. I was conscious of
plenty of reserved speed in Kaweah, whose powerful run was already
distancing their fatigued mustangs.</p>

<p>As we bounded down a roll of the plain, a cloud of dust sprang
from a ravine directly in front of me, and two black objects lifted
themselves in the sand. I drew my pistol, cocked it, whirled Kaweah
to the left, plunging by them and clearing by about six feet; a thrill
of relief came as I saw the long, white horns of Spanish cattle gleam
above the dust.</p>

<p>Unconsciously I restrained Kaweah too much, and in a moment the
Spaniards were crowding down upon me at a fearful rate. On they
came, the crash of their spurs and the clatter of their horses distinctly
heard; and as I had so often compared the beats of chronometers,
I unconsciously noted that while Kaweah’s, although painful,
yet came with regular power, the mustangs’ respiration was quick,
spasmodic, and irregular. I compared the intervals of the two mustangs,
and found that one breathed better than the other, and then,
upon counting the best mustang with Kaweah, found that he breathed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
nine breaths to Kaweah’s seven. In two or three minutes I tried it
again, finding the relation ten to seven; then I felt the victory, and I
yelled to Kaweah. The thin ears shot flat back upon his neck; lower
and lower he lay down to his run. I flung him a loose rein, and gave
him a friendly pat on the withers. It was a glorious burst of speed;
the wind rushed by and the plain swept under us with dizzying swiftness.
I shouted again, and the thing of nervous life under me bounded
on wilder and faster, till I could feel his spine thrill as with shocks
from a battery. I managed to look round—a delicate matter of speed—and
saw, far behind, the distanced villains, both dismounted, and
one horse fallen.</p>

<p>In an instant I drew Kaweah into a gentle trot, looking around
every moment, lest they should come on me unawares. In a half-mile
I reached the station, and I was cautiously greeted by a man who sat
by the barn door, with a rifle across his knees. He had seen me come
over the plain, and had also seen the Spanish horse fall. Not knowing
but he might be in league with the robbers, I gave him a careful
glance before dismounting and was completely reassured by an expression
of terror which had possession of his countenance.</p>

<p>I sprang to the ground and threw off the saddle, and after a word
or two with the man, who proved to be the sole occupant of this
station, we fell to work together upon Kaweah, my cocked pistol and
his rifle lying close at hand. We sponged the creature’s mouth, and,
throwing a sheet over him, walked him regularly up and down for
about three-quarters of an hour, and then taking him upon the open
plain, where we could scan the horizon in all directions, gave him a
thorough grooming. I never saw him look so magnificently as when
we led him down to the creek to drink: his skin was like satin, and
the veins of his head and neck stood out firm and round like whip-cords.—From

<h5>A HERO OF THE FURNACE-ROOM</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anonymous</span></p>

<p>The duty of the boiler-makers on warships is of the most dangerous
nature. In action, between actions, and out of action the repairs that
they are called upon at a moment’s notice to effect are sufficient to
send a chill of fear through the hearts of most men. They will creep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
right inside a boiler or furnace which had but a few moments before
been full of boiling liquid or hot coals. They will screw up nuts and
fasten bolts or repair leaking pipes or joints in places that other men
would consider impossible to approach. While the ship’s big guns
are making the vessel tremble, and the enemy’s shells are bursting in
every direction, these men, with positively reckless fearlessness, will
venture down into the bowels of the fighting ship, amid roaring machinery,
hissing steam, and flaming fires, to rectify an accident which,
unrepaired, might send the ship and all her human freight to the
bottom more easily and more surely and more quickly than shell or
shot from the best guns of the enemy. These men are heroes.</p>

<p>The <i>Castine</i>, when she went to work to batter the walls of San
Juan, carried on board three of these boiler-makers, Fish, another,
and one Huntley, of Norfolk, Virginia. The <i>Castine</i> went into action
under full steam, her triple screws revolving at the fullest speed, and
her battery of eight guns started her quivering with excitement and
the fierce delight of battle. The furnaces were heated almost to
white heat, and the forced draught was urging the flames to greater
heat, the boiling water to the higher production of steam, the engines
to increasing revolutions. Suddenly, without expectation, without
warning, far down in the furnace hole, unheard by officer or man,
amid the din of battle, the thundering reverberations of exploding gun-powder,
there arose a fierce hissing noise right inside one of the furnaces;
and all those who heard it trembled as no guns or shot or
shell had power to make them tremble.</p>

<p>A socket bolt in the back connection at the very farthest interior
extremity of the furnace had become loose. A leak had been sprung;
the steam was pouring in upon the fire, threatening in a few moments
to put it out and stop the progress of the ship if it did not have the more
awful effect of causing a terrible explosion and annihilation!</p>

<p>The faces of the men below, in that moment of terrible suspense,
blanched beneath the grime that covered them. None knew what to
do save to wait the awful coming of the shock they knew must come.</p>

<p>None? Nay, but there was one! The first to pull himself together,
the first to whom returned the fear-driven senses, was boiler-maker
Huntley. His name does not appear on the navy list. Even his first
name was unknown to his confrère, Fish. Only boiler-maker Huntley,
of Norfolk, Virginia. But that is enough, and the annals of fame
whenever and wherever the story of the United States and her navy
is told.</p>

<p>One instant of startled horror—then, without hesitation, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
trepidation, with stern-set jaws and fierce, devoted determination on
every line of face and form—</p>

<p>“Turn off the forced draught!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Huntley, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Bank the fire! Quick!”</p>

<p>“It’s certain death!”</p>

<p>“For one—unless, for all! Turn off the draught! Bank the fire!”</p>

<p>The orders were carried out feverishly.</p>

<p>“Now a plank!”</p>

<p>And before they could stop him this hero had flung the plank into
the furnace, right on top of the black coal with which it was banked,
and had himself climbed and crawled over the ragged mass, far back
to where the steam was rushing like some hissing devil from the
loosened socket.</p>

<p>For three minutes he remained inside that fearful place, and then
the work was done—the ship was saved—and his friends drew him
out at the door. The forced draught went to its work again, and in
an instant the furnace was once more raging.</p>

<p>But what of Huntley? Scorched, scalded, insensible, well-nigh dead,
he lay upon the iron floor of the furnace room, while around him
stood his mates dousing him with water, and using every known means
for his resuscitation. He did not die, but when once more he opened
his eyes, and was able to be carefully lifted into daylight, there arose
such cheers from the throats of those dirty, grimy mates as never
greeted taking of city or sinking of fleet.</p>

<p>The story is briefly chronicled in the log of the <i>Castine</i>, and Huntley
simply claims that he “did his duty.” But while the United States
remains a nation; so long as the banner bearing the silver stars on
the field of blue, above alternate stripes of red and white, remains the
symbol of purity, bravery, and patriotism to American hearts the
whole world over; so long, when her heroes are spoken of, one name
should never be omitted—that of Boiler-maker Huntley, of Norfolk,
Virginia.—From <i>The Toledo Blade</i>.</p>

<h5>THE DEATH IN THE WHEAT</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Frank Norris</span></p>

<p>S. Behrman soon discovered his elevator. It was the largest structure
discernible, and upon its red roof, in enormous white letters, was
his own name. Thither, between piles of grain bags, halted drays,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
crates and boxes of merchandise, with an occasional pyramid of salmon
cases, S. Behrman took his way. Cabled to the dock, close under his
elevator, lay a great ship with lofty masts and great spars. Her stern
was toward him as he approached, and upon it, in raised golden
letters, he could read the words, “<i>Swanhilda</i>—Liverpool.”</p>

<p>He went aboard by a very steep gangway and found the mate on
the quarter deck. S. Behrman introduced himself.</p>

<p>“Well,” he added, “how are you getting on?”</p>

<p>“Very fairly, sir,” returned the mate, who was an Englishman.
“We’ll have her all snugged down tight by this time day after to-morrow.
It’s a great saving of time shunting the stuff in her like
that, and three men can do the work of seven.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look ’round, I believe,” returned S. Behrman.</p>

<p>“Right-o,” answered the mate with a nod.</p>

<p>S. Behrman went forward to the hatch that opened down into
the vast hold of the ship. A great iron chute connected this hatch
with the elevator, and through it was rushing a veritable cataract of
wheat.</p>

<p>It came from some gigantic bin within the elevator itself, rushing
down the confines of the chute to plunge into the roomy, gloomy interior
of the hold with an incessant, metallic roar, persistent, steady,
inevitable. No men were in sight. The place was deserted. No
human agency seemed to be back of the movement of the wheat.
Rather, the grain seemed impelled with a force of its own, a resistless,
huge force, eager, vivid, impatient for the sea.</p>

<p>S. Behrman stood watching, his ears deafened with the roar of the
hard grains against the metallic lining of the chute. He put his hand
once into the rushing tide, and the contact rasped the flesh of his
fingers and like an undertow drew his hand after it in its impetuous
dash.</p>

<p>Cautiously he peered down into the hold. A musty odor rose to his
nostrils, the vigorous, pungent aroma of the raw cereal. It was dark.
He could see nothing; but all about and over the opening of the
hatch the air was full of a fine, impalpable dust that blinded the eyes
and choked the throat and nostrils.</p>

<p>As his eyes became used to the shadows of the cavern below him,
he began to distinguish the gray mass of the wheat, a great expanse,
almost liquid in its texture, which, as the cataract from above plunged
into it, moved and shifted in long, slow eddies. As he stood there,
this cataract on a sudden increased in volume. He turned about, casting
his eyes upward toward the elevator to discover the cause. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
foot caught in a coil of rope, and he fell headforemost into the hold.</p>

<p>The fall was a long one and he struck the surface of the wheat
with the sodden impact of a bundle of damp clothes. For the moment
he was stunned. All the breath was driven from his body. He could
neither move nor cry out. But, by degrees, his wits steadied themselves
and his breath returned to him. He looked about and above
him. The daylight in the hold was dimmed and clouded by the thick
chaff-dust thrown off by the pour of grain, and even this dimness
dwindled to twilight at a short distance from the opening of the
hatch, while the remotest quarters were lost in impenetrable blackness.
He got upon his feet only to find he sunk ankle deep in the loose
packed mass underfoot.</p>

<p>“Hell,” he muttered, “here’s a fix.”</p>

<p>Directly underneath the chute, the wheat, as it poured in, raised
itself in a conical mound, but from the sides of this mound it shunted
away incessantly in thick layers, flowing in all directions with the
nimbleness of water. Even as S. Behrman spoke, a wave of grain
poured around his legs and rose rapidly to the level of his knees. He
stepped quickly back. To stay near the chute would soon bury him to
the waist.</p>

<p>No doubt, there was some other exit from the hold, some companion
ladder that led up to the deck. He scuffled and waddled across
the wheat, groping in the dark with outstretched hands. With every
inhalation he choked, filling his mouth and nostrils more with dust
than with air. At times he could not breathe at all, but gagged and
gasped, his lips distended. But search as he would, he could find no
outlet to the hold, no stairway, no companion ladder. Again and
again, staggering along in the black darkness, he bruised his knuckles
and forehead against the iron sides of the ship. He gave up the attempt
to find any interior means of escape and returned laboriously
to the space under the open hatchway. Already he could see that
the level of the wheat was raised.</p>

<p>“God,” he said, “this isn’t going to do at all.” He uttered a great
shout. “Hello, on deck there, somebody. For God’s sake.”</p>

<p>The steady, metallic roar of the pouring wheat drowned out his
voice. He could scarcely hear it himself above the rush of the
cataract. Beside this, he found it impossible to stay under the hatch.
The flying grains of wheat, spattering as they fell, stung his face
like wind-driven particles of ice. It was a veritable torture; his hands
smarted with it. Once he was all but blinded. Furthermore, the succeeding
waves of wheat, rolling from the mound under the chute,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
beat him back, swirling and dashing against his legs and knees, mounting
swiftly higher, carrying him off his feet.</p>

<p>Once more he retreated, drawing back from beneath the hatch. He
stood still for a moment and shouted again. It was in vain. His
voice returned upon him, unable to penetrate the thunder of the chute,
and horrified, he discovered that so soon as he stood motionless upon
the wheat, he sank into it. Before he knew it, he was knee-deep again,
and a long swirl of grain sweeping outward from the ever-breaking,
ever-reforming pyramid below the chute, poured around his thighs,
immobilizing him.</p>

<p>A frenzy of terror suddenly leaped to life within him. The horror
of death, the Fear of The Trap, shook him like a dry reed. Shouting,
he tore himself free of the wheat and once more scrambled and
struggled towards the hatchway. He stumbled as he reached it and
fell directly beneath the pour. Like a storm of small shot, mercilessly,
pitilessly, the unnumbered multitude of hurtling grains flagellated and
beat and tore his flesh. Blood streamed from his forehead and, thickening
with the powder-like chaff-dust, blinded his eyes. He struggled
to his feet once more. An avalanche from the cone of wheat buried
him to his thighs. He was forced back and back and back, beating
the air, falling, rising, howling for aid. He could no longer see; his
eyes crammed with dust, smarted as if transfixed with needles whenever
he opened them. His mouth was full of the dust; his lips were
dry with it; thirst tortured him, while his outcries choked and gagged
in his rasped throat.</p>

<p>And all the while without stop, incessantly, inexorably, the wheat,
as if moving with a force all its own, shot downward in a prolonged
roar, persistent, steady, inevitable.</p>

<p>He retreated to a far corner of the hold and sat down with his
back against the iron hull of the ship and tried to collect his thoughts,
to calm himself. Surely there must be some way of escape; surely he
was not to die like this, die in this dreadful substance that was neither
solid nor fluid. What was he to do? How make himself heard?</p>

<p>But even as he thought about this, the cone under the chute broke
again and sent a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward
him. It reached him where he sat and buried his hand and one foot.</p>

<p>He sprang up trembling and made for another corner.</p>

<p>“My God,” he cried, “my God, I must think of something pretty
quick!”</p>

<p>Once more the level of the wheat rose and the grains began piling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
deeper about him. Once more he retreated. Once more he crawled,
staggering to the foot of the cataract, screaming till his ears sang and
his eyeballs strained in their sockets, and once more the relentless
tide drove him back.</p>

<p>Then began that terrible dance of death; the man dodging, doubling,
squirming, hunted from one corner to another; the wheat slowly, inexorably
flowing, rising, spreading to every angle, to every nook and
cranny. It reached his middle. Furious and with bleeding hands and
broken nails, he dug his way out to fall backward, all but exhausted,
gasping for breath in the dust-thickening air. Roused again by the
slow advance of the tide, he leaped up and stumbled away, blinded
with the agony in his eyes, only to crash against the metal hull of the
vessel. He turned about, the blood streaming from his face; he paused
to collect his senses, and with a rush, another wave swirled about his
ankles and knees. Exhaustion grew upon him. To stand still meant
to sink; to lie or sit meant to be buried the quicker; and all this in the
dark, all this in the air that could not be breathed, all this while he
fought an enemy that could not be gripped, toiling in a sea that could
not be stayed.</p>

<p>Guided by the sound of the falling wheat, S. Behrman crawled on
hands and knees toward the hatchway. Once more he raised his voice
in a shout for help. His bleeding throat and raw, parched lips refused
to utter but a wheezing moan. Once more he tried to look
toward the one patch of faint light above him. His eyelids, clogged
with chaff, could no longer open. The wheat poured about his waist
as he raised himself upon his knees.</p>

<p>Reason fled. Deafened with the roar of the grain, blinded and
made dumb with its chaff, he threw himself forward with clutching
fingers, rolling upon his back, and lay there, moving feebly, the head
rolling from side to side. The wheat, leaping continuously from the
chute, poured around him. It filled the pockets of the coat, it crept
up the sleeves and trouser legs, it covered the great, protuberant
stomach, it ran at last in rivulets into the distended, gasping mouth.
It covered the face.</p>

<p>Upon the surface of the wheat, under the chute, nothing moved but
the wheat itself. There was no sign of life. Then, for an instant,
the surface stirred. A hand, fat, with short fingers and swollen veins,
reached up, clutching, then fell limp and prone. In another instant it
was covered. In the hold of the <i>Swanhilda</i> there was no movement
but the widening ripples that spread flowing from the ever-breaking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
ever-reforming cone; no sound, but the rushing of the wheat that
continued to plunge incessantly from the iron chute in a prolonged
roar, persistent, steady, inevitable.—From “The Octopus.” Copyright

<h5>BOY WANTED</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Madge Elliot</span></p>

<p>One 24th of December, Mr. Oscar Blunt, who kept a large hat store
in the lower part of Broadway, was writing at his desk, which was
at the very end of the store, when somebody touched his elbow softly,
and, looking up, was much astounded to see a ragged boy, whose old
broad-brimmed hat almost hid his face, standing beside him. He was
so much astonished, in fact, that he dropped his pen upon his paper,
and thereby made a blot instead of a period.</p>

<p>“Why, my lad, how came you here?”</p>

<p>“I slid past some of the fellers. Wot a woppin’ big store dis is,
and wot lots of fellers it takes to stan’ ’roun’, an’ I cheeked some an’
I tole de odders I had somethin’ most awful partiklar to say to de
big boss.”</p>

<p>“And what have you most awful particular to say to me?” said the
“big boss” in a kinder voice than that in which he had spoken at first,
for there was something in the boy’s dark gray eyes that made him
think of a darling little son he had buried only a year ago in the same
grave where he had buried his wife the year before.</p>

<p>“Well, I seen in yer window a sigh wot reads, ‘Boy Wanted.’ An’
I’m a boy; an’ as nobody never wanted me yet, sez I to myself, sez
I, ‘Dusty, ole feller, p’r’haps there’s <i>your</i> chance at last,’ sez I, an’ in I
comes.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but you won’t suit at all, my boy.”</p>

<p>“How do you know ’fore you try a feller? I know I ain’t worry
pooty, nor I hain’t got no fashnoble clothes, but I’m smart, I am.
I’ve been to night-school two winters, I have, an’ got a sixth ’ward of
merit, I did, wunst, an’ I kin read readin’ fust rate wen it’s only two
syllabubbles an’ I kin spell it out wen it’s three syllabubbles, an’ I kin
speak some four syllabubbles, an’ I can read writin’ wen it’s print-letters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
an’ I kin wissel you or any oder man in des ’ere tre-men-yu-ous
(four syllabubbles) old hat-box outer his boots.” And he began to
whistle a lively tune so loudly, clearly and sweetly that everybody in
the large store turned in amazement toward the desk, and listened.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see you whistle remarkably well, but we don’t want a
boy to whistle.”</p>

<p>“I kin dance too. I danced for Johnny Sniffs ben’fit when he fell
inter wun of dem cole-holes in de sidewalk, and broke his leg off
short, I did, ’midst thunders of applause.” And cutting a double
shuffle he went off into a rollicking break-down, his big shoes wobbling
about, and the broad brim of his hat flopping up and down at every
step.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop! I tell you! I don’t want a boy to dance. You won’t
do, my boy; you won’t do, as I’ve told you before. Here’s a quarter
for you, and now go away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want de quarter; nor I don’t want to go ’way,” persisted
the boy. “I didn’t come ’way from Fishhead Alley to dis swell street
to go ’way so soon. I want a sit-u-wa-tion (four syllabubbles), I do.
An’ de fust thing I seen, wen I comes round de corner, was dat sign,
‘Boy Wanted.’ ‘An’ dat’s good luck,’ sez I. ‘Go in, Dusty ole feller,’
sez I. An’ I ain’t tole you haff what I kin do. Jess yez hole on a
minnit. I kin see a cop furder nor any our gang; an’ wen one comes
in de front door arter you, I kin give you de wink, quicker’n lightenin’,
an’ out de back door you pops. An’ I kin speak pieces, I kin—‘A
hoss! A hoss! my kingdom fer a hoss! Dere’s sixty Richmons in
de field to-day, an’ I’ve killed every wun of dem. A hoss—’”</p>

<p>“Silence!” commanded Mr. Blunt; and then in spite of himself he
burst into a fit of laughter and laughed until he shook again, and there
was a great deal of him to shake—two hundred pounds at the very
least. “Tell me something about yourself, my boy, but mind, no
more performances of any kind. What is your name, and where do
you live, to begin with?”</p>

<p>“Dusty’s my name. I don’t know no odder. One feller, he’s from
the country, he is—calls me ‘Dusty Miller’; he sez ’cause dey’s a flower
wot dey calls ‘Dusty Miller’ dare. I believe he’s foolin’. But if I’m
de boy wot’s wanted, I must get a nobbier name dan dat. Wot’s your
name, boss?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Oscar Blunt.”</p>

<p>“Well, you might call me dat, too, without de mister. It soun’s
werry nice—‘Hoss car Blunt,’ or you might keep de Hoss car, an I’d
be de El-e-wa-ted (four syllabubbles) Road Blunt. Any way you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
mind to. You pay your money, and takes your choice. An’ I lives
roun’ anywhere sence Aunt Kate died.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Kate? And was Aunt Kate your only relation? Have you
no father and mother?” asked Mr. Blunt.</p>

<p>“Nope; never had none, ’cept Aunt Kate. An’ I ain’t no frien’s,
’cept Straw Hat. He keeps a paper stan’, he does; an’ onst he giv a
party, he did, in a charcoal-box. I wos dere, an’ it wuz bully, you bet.
An’ I’ve got a little brudder.”</p>

<p>“A little brother?”</p>

<p>“Yep, sir. He wuz my cousin wunst, ’fore dey took Aunt Kate
away; but he’s my brudder now, an’ I got to take care of him. He
jess gobbles bread and milk, an’ dat’s w’y I’m lookin’ for a sit-i-wa-tion—’nother
four syllabubbles. Crackey! I’m as full of big words as a
diction’ry, I am. An’ Straw Hat he sez to me, sez he, ‘If you want
me to say you’re honest an’ sober an’ ’dustyous, I’ll say it,’ says he.
He’s a bully good feller, he is, an’ I ain’t givin’ taffy, neider. He’s
took care of me an’ my little brudder sence Aunt Kate died—dat’s
lass week—but he can’t do it forev’r’n’ever.”</p>

<p>“And where is this little brother now?”</p>

<p>“Sittin’ on your stoop, waitin’ till I come out.”</p>

<p>“Sitting on my stoop? Why he must be half frozen, poor little
fellow. Go and bring him in directly.”</p>

<p>The boy flew, and in a moment returned, leading by the hand a wee
child, who could just walk, and whose very small nose was blue with
cold, and who was wrapped in an old shawl, the ends of which dragged
behind him.</p>

<p>“He’s a boy too, an’ he’s real pooty, an’ if he’s the kind of boy yer
want, you may have him; but you must be awful good to him, an’ let
me come and see him. Say, boss, to-morrer’s Chrismus day!”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?”</p>

<p>“Wen folks all gits presents, an’ fellers wot’s got stockin’s hangs
’em up, an’ spose, boss—jess fer fun—you let me an’ my little brudder
be your Chrismus present?”</p>

<p>“Done!” said Mr. Blunt, conquered at last by the boy’s patient and
persistent coaxing. “I’ll make believe I found one in each stocking.
But mind, Dusty, you must be the best of boys, and stop using slang,
or I won’t keep you.”</p>

<p>“You kin bet you bottom dollar I’ll do everything you want me to.
Horay! ain’t dis a bully racket? I’m de boy wot’s wanted in dis
es-tab-lish-ment (four syllabubbles) an’ I mean to be in-wal-u-a-ble—five
syllabubbles, by gracious! Mind my little brudder a minnit till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
I run an’ tell Straw Hat.” And before Mr. Blunt could say a word,
the crown of the hat was on his head, and he was out of the store
and away.</p>

<p>And when he returned with Straw Hat the baby was sitting in the
lap of the good natured colored woman who kept the store clean, as
happy as any baby could be who had just eaten four sugar cakes and
a stick of candy.</p>

<p>And Dusty E. Road proved himself to be, as he himself said he
would be, the very boy wanted in that establishment.</p>

<h5>THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF LOVE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Amanda Mathews</span></p>

<p>The mother of Teodota sat in the doorway with a bowl of meat
in her lap. Her greasy black dress wrinkled latitudinally about her
shapeless figure. Her countenance was smooth, blank, and oily. As
she cut the meat into bits for the tamales, an impotent dribble of
monologue flowed from her flabby, pendulous lips. While awake,
talking was a function as natural and continuous as respiration or
digestion, and was interrupted only when her present husband exerted
himself to beat or kick her into a brief interval of sniffling repression.
On this particular afternoon Señor Garcia was not interested in damming
the sluggish but endless current of his wife’s conversation, for
he lay in drunken sleep on a filthy blanket in a corner of the rough
board pen, a Mexican Caliban, swart, lowbrowed, bestial.</p>

<p>Teodota knelt behind the metate grinding corn to be mixed with
chile in the pungent tamales. She had dragged the clumsy stone implement
to a position where she could see that her stepfather still
slept, notwithstanding his frightful inarticulate gulps and growls. A
thin, flat-chested slip of a girl was Teodota, with great, piteous brown
eyes, high cheek bones, small, pointed chin, and a complexion of tan
satin. She was not beautiful; rather was she an intaglio of beauty
with hollows where there should have been roundness. Her untidy
black braids had been slept on many times since they had known a
comb; the scant, tattered calico gown fell away from the upturned
leathery soles of her bare feet. She guided the heavy stone roller
with languid, perfunctory movements, while some clockwork in her
brain prompted the periodical “Si, madre,” that fully satisfied her
mother’s conversational requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>The real Teodota was back in Old Mexico. Certainly she was not
driven thither by any lack of familiar environment in the Mexican
quarter of Los Angeles. Nor would it seem necessary for Teodota
to keep tryst in Mexico with a lover who had not preceded her to the
United States, but they had not found each other yet and she could
meet her Pablo only at the plaza fountain in Texcoco.</p>

<p>Suddenly into the dream, but not of it, a white folded paper fluttered
through the open window and lay on the floor beside the metate.
The girl examined it curiously.</p>

<p>“What is it, daughter?” inquired the elder woman.</p>

<p>“I do not know, mother. It looks like drawing; I am sure it isn’t
writing.”</p>

<p>“I can use it to light my cigarette.”</p>

<p>“No, mamacita, I want it.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The girl hid the paper where billows of a not overclean chemise
escaped at long gaps between buttons, and returned to her labor, but
the apparently trifling incident had taken a certain hold on her listless,
stunted intelligence. Recklessly, she pushed a handful of corn off the
end of the metate and edged about on her knees as if to pick it up, in
order to study the document with her back to her mother. The unlettered
brain, not accustomed to flat symbols for the appearance of
things, was slow to find any significance in the lines. Very gradually
did she achieve recognition of a railway train and the human figures,
male and female.</p>

<p>As her stepfather pulled himself into a sitting posture she thrust the
paper back into her bosom, trembling lest he had seen it, and still
more lest he beat her for the unground corn.</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i>” he growled. “May the roof fall upon the Labor Union.”</p>

<p>Mother and daughter exchanged glances of relief that, so far, the
object of his wrath was remote and intangible.</p>

<p>“They told me in Mexico,” he continued, “of a fine thing here in
America called the Labor Union that pays a man when he does not
work, that throws stones at him if he is such a fool as to desire
work, and calls him—calls him—a pest overtake their speech that is
hard as rocks in the mouth—”</p>

<p>“Scabe, <i>padre</i>,” supplied Teodota, timidly.</p>

<p>“I come here with my innocent family. I seek out this Labor Union
and say, ‘Here am I, Juan Garcia, who is no—no—’”</p>

<p>“Scabe, <i>padre</i>,” ventured the girl again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“But hates work like the very devil. Do they embrace me? Do
they put money in my hand? Ah-h-h!”</p>

<p>His memory of the rest of that painful interview, when a muscular
labor leader chose to consider that he was being trifled with, vented
itself in a shrill howl of rage.</p>

<p>Teodota caught up a brown earthen pitcher, and slipping out as
though to bring water from the hydrant, hid herself behind a scrubby
red geranium in the angle between the last tenement and the high
board fence. At first she crouched in wretched fear of being dragged
forth to receive a beating, or witness one bestowed upon her mother,
but the minutes slipped by without pursuit.</p>

<p>It was not because she needed to exercise her reposeful wits during
this period of hiding that she fell to studying the paper again, but
rather on account of a pleasant stir in some rudimentary faculty that
under happier circumstances might have been imagination. Man, boy,
woman, train, mules, she identified with growing ease and satisfaction.
For her, it was a notable mental achievement when she perceived
relations among the members of the groups of objects.</p>

<p>That man was kissing the hand of the maiden with a water-jar on
her shoulder. Even so had Pablo kissed her hand under the <i>portales</i>
that last morning, and when she inquired saucily if she were his grandmother,
he snatched her to him and kissed both cheeks and called her
<i>queridita</i>. In the next square the same girl was being flogged. Even
so had she been used by her stepfather, who wished her to have no
lover, but to continue making tamales for his support. Her beloved
had left for the United States in just such a train.</p>

<p>This was a communication from Pablo! That supreme illumination
in her dim intellect was a blessed miracle of love. She kissed the
picture-letter and rocked back and forth, hugging it, while her heart
nearly leaped out of her joy. Then she fell to studying it anew. The
square showing forth a man driving a team of mules hitched to a
scraper was beyond her comprehension, as she was unfamiliar with
grading camps.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the sheet the boy with the shirt-waist and simulated
fur cap was receiving a letter, running with it, and in the last
square, delivering it to the maiden. Dear Pablo evidently believed
that this boy was the messenger between them, whereas it must have
been the angels or the saints, for had she not seen the boy looking as
innocent and indifferent as you please?</p>

<p>When Teodota returned to the squalid room her stepfather had a
more immediate grievance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“You impudent, lazy hussy! You <i>sin verguenza</i>! I’ll teach you to
leave your work and gad about the court!”</p>

<p>“If you touch me again,” blazed the girl, “you’d better keep awake.
I’ll kill you if I ever catch you asleep!”</p>

<p>A rabbit at bay is at least a surprise, and the brute’s jaw dropped,
the upraised arm fell back, and cursing and blustering, he strolled
forth into the court. With a champion hovering near, there had suddenly
come to the girl the power to hate bravely. Heretofore she had
feared her stepfather as the savage who dares not hate the evil powers
moving in the darkness lest they perceive his hatred and smite him
afresh.</p>

<p>“Daughter! daughter!” wailed the frightened mother, “that was not
a respectful manner to address a parent. When I was a girl it was
the custom—”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, madre</i>,” responded Teodota, patiently, as she indited her answer
to her lover with a burnt match on a scrap of wrapping paper.
Roughly, but eloquently, she sketched two little imploring hands, and
flung the epistle from the window with childlike confidence that whatever
powers had brought Pablo’s letter would convey her reply.</p>

<p>It was a transformed Teodota that stood just out of the heavy
wooden gates of the court the next morning, apparently loitering in
idle contemplation of the street, where Latin infants disported themselves
on the sidewalks, and soft Spanish speech was heard in every
doorway, but in reality her whole body was charged with excitement
and impatience. Personal neatness in a board pen devoted chiefly to
the manufacture of tamales could not be expected to attain any high
standard, but her appearance this morning bore eloquent testimony to
the civilizing power of love. Her abundant black hair, moist and
glossy, rippled on her shoulders, with a red geranium glowing in its
shadows. The billows of chemise between the distant buttons were
snowy white, the worst rents in the tattered pink gown had been
roughly mended, and even the blue <i>rebozo</i> lying across her shoulders
had taken on a faded purity.</p>

<p>As though to set the seal of heavenly approval on such cleanliness,
another communication from Pablo was found pinned to the <i>rebozo</i>
when she drew it in from the window where it had swung to dry.
That the small boy was not in sight was ample proof that it had come
by supernatural agency.</p>

<p>This last letter said more eloquently than mere words could have
done: “I await thee at the tunnel.” Yet with seeming nonchalance,
Teodota watched the squat, receding figure of her stepfather abroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
on the only tasks compatible with his dignity and tastes—the delivery
of the tamales to a dealer down the street, and the collection of the
revenue therefrom. The very instant, however, that he disappeared
into a doorway, she was off in the opposite direction, wrapping her
<i>rebozo</i> about her head as she went, and giving the end a final fling
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>At the Mexican end of the tunnel, just beyond the Chinese laundry,
but before one enters the cavernous chill and shadow, stands an unroofed
adobe<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> hovel close to the highway. Teodota, hurrying by this
ruin, thrilled from head to foot to hear her name.</p>

<p>“Pablo!” she gasped. Her soul rode the wave of joy to its crest;
then dropped back into the trough of despair. “I took you for <i>gente
decente</i>! How fine you are! How elegant! A grand señor!”</p>

<p>The tall, handsome Aztec looked down complacently at his black suit
and the ends of his red tie, not displeased at the impression he made.</p>

<p>“Didst think, <i>queridita</i>,” he laughed, kissing her cheeks as he had
done under the <i>portales</i>, “that here in America I would be wearing
white cotton trousers and leather sandals? No, indeed! This is another
day.”</p>

<p>“But I, Señor—”</p>

<p>“Call me not ‘Señor,’ but Pablo and thy sweetheart,” he cried, swinging
her to the top of a crumbling wall, where she was obliged to
cling to him most deliciously.</p>

<p>“You will be ashamed of me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, little one, we will soon mend thy distress. I know of a store
not far from here with a sign—I cannot speak the strange word, but
it looks thus.” With a pencil he scrawled on a bit of plaster still
clinging to the adobe: RUMMAGE SALE.</p>

<p>“This is a strange country, Teodota. At home it is the poor who
sell their clothes—mostly in the pawn-shops, though my uncle had six
serapes bought off his back by gringo tourists. Here, it is the aristocrats
who sell their garments to the poor, and very cheap, though,
of course, one offers the half. Poor rich, to lose their pretty clothes,
but I suppose the rents are high where they live, and they must have
plenty to eat, being so accustomed. I can buy thee silk and velvet
and thou shalt be a grand señora, as I am a grand señor.”</p>

one must get a permit to marry, though the priest really does the work.

<p>“Oh, Pablo! Now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>querida</i>.”</p>

<p>Hand in hand, the lovers left the adobe, and the somber echoing

end, was to them an underground passage to Paradise.</p>

<h5>THE INTERVENTION OF PETER</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Paul Laurence Dunbar</span></p>

<p>No one knows just what statement it was of Harrison Randolph’s
that Bob Lee doubted. The annals of these two Virginia families have
not told us that. But these are the facts:</p>

<p>It was at the home of the Fairfaxes that a few of the sons of the
old Dominion were giving a dinner, and a brave dinner it was. The
courses had come and gone, and over their cigars they had waxed
more than merry. In those days men drank deep, and these men were
young, full of the warm blood of the South and the joy of living.
What wonder then that the liquor that had been mellowing in the
Fairfax cellars since the boyhood of their revolutionary ancestor should
have its effect upon them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>It is true that it was only a slight thing which Bob Lee affected to
disbelieve, and that his tone was jocosely bantering rather than impertinent.
But sometimes Virginia heads are not less hot than Virginia
hearts. The two young men belonged to families that had intermarried.
They rode together, hunted together and were friends as far as
two men could be who had read the message of love in the dark eyes
of the same woman. So perhaps there was some thought of the long-contested
hand of Miss Sallie Ford in Harrison Randolph’s mind when
he chose to believe that his honor had been assailed.</p>

<p>His dignity was admirable. There was no scene to speak of. It
was all very genteel.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lee,” he said, “had chosen to doubt his word, which to a gentleman
was a final insult. But he felt sure that Mr. Lee would not
refuse to accord him a gentleman’s satisfaction.” And the other’s face
had waxed warm and red and his voice cold as he replied: “I shall
be most happy to give you the satisfaction you demand.”</p>

<p>Here friends interposed and attempted to pacify the two. But without
avail.</p>

<p>Each of the young men nodded to a friend and rose to depart. The
joyous dinner-party bade fair to end with much more serious business.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You shall hear from me very shortly,” said Randolph, as he strode
to the door.</p>

<p>“I shall await your pleasure with impatience, sir, and give you such a
reply as even you cannot disdain.”</p>

<p>Peter, the personal attendant of Harrison Randolph, stood at the
door as his master passed out, and went on before him to hold his
stirrup. The young master and his friend and cousin, Dale, started off
briskly and in silence, while Pete, with wide eyes and disturbed face,
followed on behind. Just as they were turning into the avenue of elms
that led to their own house, Randolph wheeled his horse and came
riding back to his servant.</p>

<p>“Pete,” said he sternly, “what do you know?”</p>

<p>“Nuffin’, Mas’ Ha’ison, nuffin’ ’t all. I do’ know nuffin’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you.” The young master’s eyes were shining through
the dusk. “You’re always slipping around spying on me.”</p>

<p>“Now, dah you goes, Mas’ Randolph. I ain’t done a thing, and you
got to ’mence pickin’ on me—”</p>

<p>“I just want you to remember that my business is mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I knows dat.”</p>

<p>“And if you do know anything, it will be well for you to begin forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
it right now. Take Bess around and see her attended to.
Leave Dale’s horse here, and—I won’t want you any more to-night.”</p>

<p>Pete turned away with an injured expression on his dark face.
“Bess,” he said to the spirited black mare, as he led her toward the
stables, “you jes’ better t’ank yo’ Makah dat you ain’t no human bein’,
’ca’se human bein’s is cur’ous articles. Now you’s a horse, ain’t you?
And dey say you ain’t got no soul, but you got sense, Bess, you got
sense. You’s a high steppah, too, but you don’ go to work an’ try to
brek yo’ naik de fus’ chanst you git. Bess, I ’spect you ’ca’se you got
jedgment, an’ you don’ have to have a black man runnin’ aftah you all
de time plannin’ his head off jes’ to keep you out o’ trouble. Some
folks dat’s human bein’s does. Yet an’ still, Bess, you ain’t nuffin’ but
a dumb beas’, so dey says. Now, what I gwine to do? Co’se dey
wants to fight. But whah an’ when an’ how I gwine to stop hit?
Doan want me to wait on him to-night, huh! No, dey want to mek
dey plans an’ do’ want me ’roun’ to hyeah, dat’s what’s de mattah.
Well, I lay I’ll hyeah somep’n’ anyhow.”</p>

<p>Peter hurried through his work and took himself up to the big
house and straight to his master’s room. He heard voices within, but
though he took many liberties with his owner, eavesdropping was not
one of them. It proved too dangerous. So, though he lingered on
the mat, it was not for long, and he unceremoniously pushed the door
open and walked in. With a great show of haste, he made for his
master’s wardrobe and began busily searching among the articles
therein. Harrison Randolph and his cousin were in the room, and
their conversation, which had been animated, suddenly ceased when
Peter entered.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you I didn’t want you any more to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’s a-lookin’ fu’ dem striped pants o’ yo’n. I want to tek ’m out
an’ bresh ’em; dey’s pintly a livin’ sight.”</p>

<p>“You get out o’ here.”</p>

<p>“But, Mas’ Ha’ison, now—now—look-a-hyeah—”</p>

<p>“Get out, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Pete shuffled from the room, mumbling as he went: “Dah now, dah
now! driv’ out lak’ a dog! How’s I gwine to fin’ out anyt’ing dis way?
It do ’pear lak Mas’ Ha’ison do try to give me all de trouble he know
how. Now he plannin’ and prijickin’ wif dat cousin Dale an’ one jes’
ez scattah-brained ez de othah. Well, I ’low I got to beat dis time
somehow er ruther.”</p>

<p>He was still lingering hopeless and worried about the house when
he saw young Dale Randolph come out, mount his horse, and ride away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
After a while his young master also came out and walked up and down
in the soft evening air. The rest of the family were seated about on
the broad piazza.</p>

<p>“I wonder what is the matter with Harrison to-night,” said the
young man’s father, “he seems so preoccupied.”</p>

<p>“Thinking of Sallie Ford, I reckon,” some one replied; and the remark
passed with a laugh. Pete was near enough to catch this, but he
did not stop to set them right in their conjectures. He slipped into
the house.</p>

<p>It was less than two hours after this when Dale Randolph returned
and went immediately to his cousin’s room, where Harrison followed
him.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the latter, as soon as the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>“It’s all arranged, and he’s anxious to hurry it through for fear
some one may interfere. Pistols, and to-morrow morning at daybreak.”</p>

<p>“And the place?”</p>

<p>“The little stretch of woods that borders Ford’s Creek. I say, Harrison,
it isn’t too late to stop this thing yet. It’s a shame for you two
fellows to fight. You’re both too decent to be killed yet.”</p>

<p>“He insulted me.”</p>

<p>“Without intention, every one believes.”</p>

<p>“Then let him apologize.”</p>

<p>“As well ask the devil to take Communion.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fight then.”</p>

<p>“All right. If you must fight you must. But you’d better go to bed,
for you’ll need a strong arm and a steady hand to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write a couple of letters first,” he said; “then I shall
lie down for an hour or so. And, by the way, Dale, if I—if it happens
to be me to-morrow, you take Pete; he’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p>The cousins clasped hands in silence and passed out. As the door
closed behind them a dusky form rolled out from under the bed and
the disreputable, eavesdropping, backsliding Peter stood up and rubbed
a sleeve across his eyes.</p>

<p>“It ain’t me dat’s gwine to be give to nobody else. I hates to do it;
but dey ain’t no othah way. Mas’ Ha’ison cain’t be spaihed.” He
glided out mysteriously, some plan of salvation working in his black
head.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Just before daybreak next morning three stealthy figures crept out
and made their way toward Ford’s Creek. One skulked behind the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
other two, dogging their steps and taking advantage of the darkness to
keep very near to them. At the grim trysting-place they halted and
were soon joined by other stealthy figures, and together they sat down
to wait for the daylight. The seconds conferred for a few minutes.
The ground was paced off, and a few, low-pitched orders prepared the
young men for business.</p>

<p>“I will count three, gentlemen,” said Lieutenant Custis. “At three,
you are to fire.”</p>

<p>At last daylight came, gray and timid at first, and then red and bold
as the sun came clearly up. The pistols were examined and the men
placed face to face.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>But evidently Harrison Randolph was not. He was paying no attention
to the seconds. His eyes were fixed on an object behind his
opponent’s back. His attitude relaxed and his mouth began to twitch.
Then he burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>“Pete,” he roared, “drop that and come out from there!” and away
he went into another convulsion of mirth. The others turned just in
time to see Pete cease his frantic grimaces of secrecy at his master,
and sheepishly lower an ancient fowling-piece which he had had leveled
at Bob Lee.</p>

<p>“What were you going to do with that gun leveled at me?” asked
Lee, his own face twitching.</p>

<p>“I was gwine to fiah jes’ befo’ dey said free. I wa’n’t gwine to kill
you, Mas’ Bob. I was on’y gwine to lame you.”</p>

<p>Another peal of laughter from the whole crowd followed this condescending
statement.</p>

<p>“You unconscionable scoundrel, you! If I was your master, I’d
give you a hundred lashes.”</p>

<p>“Pete,” said his master, “don’t you know that it is dishonorable to
shoot a man from behind? You see you haven’t in you the making
of a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I do’ know nuffin’ ’bout mekin’ a gent’man, but I does know how
to save one dat’s already made.”</p>

<p>The prime object of the meeting had been entirely forgotten. They
gathered around Pete and examined the weapon.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Randolph, “we have been saved by a miracle.
This old gun, as well as I can remember and count, has been loaded
for the past twenty-five years, and if Pete had tried to fire it, it
would have torn up all this part of the country.”</p>

<p>Then the eyes of the two combatants met. There was something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
irresistibly funny in the whole situation, and they found themselves
roaring again. Then, with one impulse, they shook hands without a
word.</p>

<p>And Pete led the way home, the willing butt of a volume of good-natured
abuse.—From “Folks from Dixie,” copyright by <i>Dodd, Mead
&amp; Company</i>, New York, and used by arrangement.</p>

</div>

<p>What charm and delight surround a sweet, melodious voice,
whether of woman or man. Who is there that does not recall
such a voice and its influence upon him? Who does not have
clinging memories of the voice of the mother, crooning over
her babe, or singing a sweet lullaby as it lay at her breast; of a
father, softening its strong and resonant power to soothe the
restlessness of his little one who was sick; of the blushing
maiden, who consciously or unconsciously had learned the immeasurably
greater power exercised over her fellows, whether
of her own or the opposite sex, by a soft, pure, well-controlled
voice, rather than the high-pitched, tense, loud and harsh chatter
of her associates. The calm, quiet, soft and low-pitched,
though firm, voice of the teacher, the parent, the employer, the
salesman, the speaker, the statesman, is far more effective, far
more likely to attain its end than the harsh, raucous, loud, too
emphatic and high-pitched voice of the uncontrolled, untaught,
or careless speaker. And to listen to a reader, be he preacher,
lawyer, judge, or orator, reading in public to a large audience,
or for the pleasure and instruction of his own loved
ones, or a few chosen friends, whose voice is melodious in
every cadence, whose every intonation is musical and in good
taste, what joy such a reader is able to bestow. How memory
thrills as we recall a few readers of this type. Why should
they be so few? Why should there be so many harsh, nasal,
raucous, high-pitched, unmelodious voices? The reason is
found mainly in lack of training, lack of a little thought, indifference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
to the possession of the finer gifts of life. For
every boy and girl has it in his or her power, by the exercise
of a little care, a little thought, a little self-restraint, a little
time spent in discipline to produce the sweet and charming
voice, with clean-cut, distinct, pleasing enunciation and pronunciation
that will afford joy during the whole of a long life.</p>

<p>One’s own ear will tell whether his voice is properly pitched,
pleasing, melodious, or the opposite. A few minutes spent in
speech daily before a looking-glass will forever fix the habit
of making the face pleasing; and an hour a day for a month
will fix perfect habits of pronunciation and enunciation that
will remain through life. When these arts are fixed, then a
few hours’ study of the thought of the author and the inflections
and modulations of the voice necessary to represent, to
convey to the ear of the listener, the full power of that thought,
and the reader has equipped himself, herself, to give joy to
countless thousands. Is it not worth while to spend a few
hours to gain such power?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercises in Inflection</span></h4>

<p>By inflection is meant the glide of the voice within a word
to a higher or a lower pitch. This glide may be quick and
short, or long and slow. It may be a rising or a falling glide,
or both. The value of inflection rests in its power to make
what is said more emphatic, to aid in clear enunciation, to aid
in overcoming monotony. On all emphasized words we have
an intensified inflection. This is illustrated in Portia’s speech
in “The Merchant of Venice.” In studying this excerpt we
discover that all the emphasized words have a pronounced
inflection. In the first group of words, “If to do were as easy
as to <i>know</i> what were good to do,” we find the most intensified
inflection is upon the word “know” because this is the most
emphatic word of the group. This reveals that inflection is
one of the most vital means of emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>In regard to inflection as an aid to clear enunciation, we
find that inflection occurs upon the accented syllable of a long
word, and if due attention is given to the syllable upon which
the accent falls, the word will receive a more perfect utterance.
For instance, we can readily see in the following words, which
are often mispronounced, the important part that inflection
plays in the proper pronunciation of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>abdomen</li>
<li>abject</li>
<li>acclimate</li>
<li>address</li>
<li>admirable</li>
<li>alias</li>
<li>brigand</li>
<li>caricature</li>
<li>chastisement</li>
<li>chauffeur</li>
<li>combatant</li>
<li>contumely</li>
<li>demoniacal</li>
<li>discourse</li>
<li>exquisite</li>
<li>finance</li>
<li>grimace</li>
<li>herculean</li>
<li>horizon</li>
<li>impious</li>
<li>impotent</li>
<li>incomparable</li>
<li>indisputable</li>
<li>industry</li>
<li>inexplicable</li>
<li>interpolate</li>
<li>inquiry</li>
<li>lyceum</li>
<li>mausoleum</li>
<li>mischievous</li>
<li>obligatory</li>
<li>research</li>
<li>resource</li>
<li>superfluous</li>
<li>traverse</li>
<li>vagary</li>
<li>vehement</li>
<li>vehicle</li>
<li>virago</li>
<li>verbose</li>
<li>virtue</li>
<li>virtually</li>
</ul>

<p>(<i>For the correct pronunciations see Webster’s New International
Dictionary.</i>)</p>

<p>We readily see that the proper use of inflection cannot help
but give variety and contrast to our speech, and this aids immeasurably
in overcoming the persistent use of monotones.</p>

<p>We shall take up the different kinds of inflection and illustrate
them with appropriate exercises. The student should
consider the aim and value of each kind of inflection and then
proceed to practice orally the exercises, listening intently to
his voice to see that it responds.</p>

<h5><i>Kinds of Inflection</i></h5>

<p>Falling Glide in the voice indicates a complete and positive
assertion. For example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Prince’s banner wavered, staggered backward, hemmed by foes!”</p>

</div>

<p>A command, although punctuated with a question mark, is
rendered with a falling glide in the voice. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Halt! who goes there?” “Speak, what trade art thou?”</p>

</div>

<p>Rising Glide in the voice indicates incompleteness and doubt.
For example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How ‘the fellow by the name of Rowan’ took the letter, sealed it up
in an oilskin pouch, strapped it over his heart, in four days landed by
night off the coast of Cuba from an open boat, disappeared into the
jungle, and in three weeks came out on the other side of the island,
having traversed a hostile country on foot, and delivered his letter to
Garcia, are things I have no special desire now to tell in detail.”</p>

</div>

<p>Circumflex Glide indicates a twist in the voice which reflects
a like twist in the mind.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Well, I guess I’ll have to, since you say so.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Study of Pitch</span></h4>

<p>Pitch is simply the modulation of the voice as high or low.
In natural speech we seldom have more than one word on the
same pitch. Note the constant change of pitch in a good conversationalist.
In listening to such, we discover what?</p>

<p><i>First</i>: If one idea is expressed on one pitch, its antithesis is
instinctively expressed on another pitch. For example:
“When our vices <i>leave us</i>, we flatter ourselves we <i>leave them</i>.”
“The prodigal <i>robs his heir</i>, the miser <i>robs himself</i>.” “<i>Excess</i>
of ceremony shows <i>want</i> of breeding.”</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: A quick leap of the mind causes a leap in the voice,
or, in other words, it causes a change of pitch. For example:
“So you say you are going to—Well, hello, John! How did
you get here?”</p>

<p>There can be no definite rules laid down governing Changes
of Pitch. If we think progressively, giving ourselves completely
to each successive idea, permitting our movement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
tone to be the direct outcome of the <i>action of the mind</i> we
shall have no difficulty in modulating our pitch.</p>

<p>In reading the following selections, note carefully the natural
tendency of the voice to change pitch as the mind leaps
from one thought to another.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Study in Stress</span></h4>

<p>If we read or speak aloud naturally and earnestly, there
occurs in our voice a succession of beats or pulsations. If
these pulsations occur at regular intervals, our speech will
be “singsong” and monotonous. Thus:</p>

<p>The fault is that we are responding to the rhythm of the line
instead of the rhythm of the thought. There should be
rhythmic action of the <i>voice</i>, but, at all times, it should be in
perfect harmony with the rhythmic action of the <i>mind</i>. Therefore,
we see again that correct <i>reading</i> depends upon getting
the correct <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>It is very important that we have control of our voice in
stress or force of utterance. If a teacher requires one pupil
out of a class of twenty to go on an errand for him, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
but one way of clearly expressing that thought in the following
sentence: Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Will <i>you</i> please return this book to the library?</p>

</div>

<p>If we make prominent any other word than “you,” we shall
not be clear as to who shall return the book. Read the above
sentence in as many ways as there are different meanings.</p>

<p>Practice reading aloud the following with especial attention
to stress. Be sure that the action of the voice corresponds to
the action of the mind. Stress is indicated by italics.</p>

<p>We say to you (our opponents) that you have made the definition of
a business man too limited in its application. The man who is employed
for wages is as much a business man as his employer; the
attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation
counsel in a great metropolis; the merchant at the cross-roads
store is as much a business man as the merchant of New York; the
farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, who begins in
the spring and toils all summer, and who by application of brain and
muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth, is as
much a business man as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade
and bets upon the price of grain; the miners who go down a thousand
feet into the earth, or climb 2,000 feet upon the cliffs, and bring forth
from their hiding-places the precious metals to be poured into the
channels of trade, are as much business men as the few financial magnates
who in a back room corner the money of the world. We come
to speak for this broader class of business men.</p>

of life, which has come to you by the grace of God.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Study of the Pause</span></h4>

<p>When we pause we suspend our speech, but continue our
thought. It is a resting place for us better to conceive of the
importance either of the thought just expressed or of the one
that follows. The mind is busy re-creating a new idea for the
one who is listening. Pausing gives time for the speaker to
get the new idea and it also gives time for the auditor to hear
the new idea. It often occurs that we are more impressive
during the interval of pausing than during the interval of
speech. The majority of people in ordinary conversation do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
not use the pause enough. One result is that they are uninteresting
and monotonous in speech.</p>

<p>In the following excerpt, taken from an address by Henry
Ward Beecher, indicate the frequency of pauses and then tell
fully, in your own words, what the successive ideas are upon
which the mind is concentrating:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now, a living force that brings to itself all the resources of the
imagination, all the inspirations of feeling, all that is influential in
body, in voice, in eye, in gesture, in posture, in the whole animated
man, is in strict analogy with the divine thought and the divine arrangement;
and there is no misconception more utterly untrue and fatal
than this: that oratory is an artificial thing, which deals with baubles
and trifles, for the sake of making bubbles of pleasure for transient
effect on mercurial audiences. So far from that, it is the consecration
of the whole man to the noblest purposes to which one can address
himself—the education and inspiration of his fellow-men by all that
there is in learning, by all that there is in thought, by all that there
is in feeling, by all that there is in all of them, sent home through the
channels of taste and beauty. And so regarded, oratory should take
its place among the highest departments of education.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Study of the Importance of Tone</span></h4>

<p>When we are speaking in ordinary conversation, or in public
address, the tones we use have much to do in making our
meaning clear. How often a person, merely by the tone of his
voice, conveys an entirely different meaning than was intended.
He is accused of being sarcastic when he had no intention that
his remark should be so regarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>Let us remember that in whatever state of mind we may be
it is unconsciously reflected in our voice. If we feel timid,
embarrassed or self-conscious it is registered in our tone
when we speak. On the other hand, if we feel gay, optimistic,
earnest and confident these moods are likewise revealed
in our speech. Thus we find tone to be an index to
character.</p>

<p>The function of tone-color is most important. It reveals
the subtle changes of our thoughts and feelings. It can make
the hearer see more clearly and feel more deeply what you say.
Nothing so quickly reveals your sincerity of purpose as the
tone of your voice. It is the source of the greatest pleasure
to the hearer. It marks you as a cultured person. And best
of all it cannot be regulated by rule. If you can express the
tone admiration in colloquial language, there is no reason why
you cannot express it in the language of a Browning or a
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In Part II instructions were given in word analysis and
thought-grouping. Let the student analyze the words, outline
the thought-groups and determine just where the pause naturally
falls, and whether the interval of rest is long or short, in
the following selections. He should also be able to explain
just why certain groups are separated by a long, and others by
a short, pause.</p>

<h5>A MESSAGE TO GARCIA</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Elbert Hubbard</span></p>

<p class="center">(Extract from <i>The Philistine</i> for March, 1899.)</p>

<p>When war broke out between Spain and the United States, it was
necessary to communicate quickly with the leader of the Insurgents.
Garcia was somewhere in the mountain fastnesses of Cuba—no one
knew where. No mail or telegraph message could reach him. The
President must secure his coöperation, and quickly.</p>

<p>What to do!</p>

<p>Some one said to the President, “There’s a fellow by the name of
Rowan will find Garcia for you if anybody can.” Rowan was sent for
and given a letter to be delivered to Garcia. How “the fellow by the
name of Rowan” took the letter, sealed it up in an oilskin pouch,
strapped it over his heart, in four days landed by night off the coast
of Cuba from an open boat, disappeared into the jungle, and in three
weeks came out on the other side of the island, having traversed a
hostile country on foot, and delivered his letter to Garcia, are things I
have no special desire now to tell in detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>The point I wish to make is this: McKinley gave Rowan a letter to
be delivered to Garcia; Rowan took the letter and did not ask “Where
is he at?” By the Eternal! there is a man whose form should be cast
in deathless bronze and the statue placed in every college of the land.
It is not book-learning young men need, nor instructions about this
and that, but a stiffening of the vertebræ which will cause them to be
loyal to a trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies; do the
thing—“Carry a message to Garcia!”</p>

<p>The following is a one-minute composition by a student,
illustrating the power of tone and also of mood suspense:</p>

<p>The lion crept stealthily onward, ever onward, with his eyes fixedly
staring at the unfortunate boy who cowered before him. The boy,
trembling from head to foot, backed slowly toward a yawning precipice.
He was on the edge! The loose earth was slowly crumbling
under his feet! He was falling! The earth was coming up to meet
him at a terrific rate. Another second, and he would be dashed to
death on those rocks below!</p>

<p>Then a sweet voice called to him: “Time to get up, Johnnie.”</p>

<p>A most striking example of the power of suspense is Mark
Twain’s story of “The Golden Arm.”</p>

<p>Once ’pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man, ’en he live ’way out
in de prairie all ’lone by hisself, ’cep’n he had a wife. En bimeby she
died, en he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en buried her.
Well, she had a golden arm—all solid gold, fum de shoulder down.
He wuz pow’ful mean—pow’ful; en dat night he couldn’t sleep, caze
he want dat golden arm so bad.</p>

<p>When it come midnight he couldn’t stan’ it no mo; so he git up,
he did, en tuck his lantern en shoved out throo de storm en dug her up
en got de golden arm; en he bent his head down ’gin de win’, en
plowed, en plowed, en plowed throo de snow. Den all on a sudden he
stop (make a considerable pause here, and look startled, and take a
listening attitude) en say: “My <i>lan’</i>, what’s dat!”</p>

<p>En he listen—en listen—en de win’ say (set your teeth together and
imitate the wailing and wheezing singsong of the wind), “Bzzz-z-zzz”—en
den, way back yonder whah de grave is, he hear a <i>voice</i>!—he
hear a voice all mix’ up in de win’—can’t hardly tell ’em ’part—“Bzzz-zzz—W-h-o—g-o-t—m-y—g-o-l-d-e-n
<i>Arm</i>?—zzz-zzz—W-H-O G-O-T<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
M-Y G-O-L-D-E-N <i>ARM</i>?” (You must begin to shiver violently now.)</p>

<p>En he begin to shiver en shake, en say, “Oh, my! Oh, my lan’! en de
win’ blow de lantern out, en de snow en sleet blow in his face en ’mos’
choke him, en he start a-plowin’ knee-deep towards home mos’ dead,
he so sk’yerd—en pooty soon he hear de voice agin, en (pause) it is
comin’ <i>after</i> him! Bzzz-zzz-zzz—W-h-o—G-o-t—M-y—G-o-l-d-e-n
<i>arm</i>?”</p>

<p>When he git in de pasture he hear it agin—closter now, en a-comin’!—a-comin’
back dah in de dark en de storm—(repeat the wind and the
voice). When he git to de house he rush upstairs en jump in de bed
en kiver up, head and years, en lay dah shiverin’ en shakin’—en den
way out dah he hear it <i>ag’in</i>!—en <i>a-comin’</i>! En bimeby he hear
(pause—awed, listening attitude)—pat—pat—pat—hit’s <i>a-comin’ upstairs</i>!
Den he hear de latch, en he know it’s in de room!</p>

<p>Den pooty soon he know it’s <i>a-standin’ by his bed</i>! (Pause.) Den—he
know it’s <i>a-bendin’ down over him</i>—en he cain’t skasely git his
breath! Den—den—he seem to feel somethin’ <i>c-o-l-d</i>, right down ’most
agin his head! (Pause.)</p>

<p>Den de voice say, <i>right at his ear</i>—“W-h-o—g-o-t—m-y—g-o-l-d-e-n
<i>arm</i>?” (You must wail it out plaintively and accusingly; then you
stare steadily and impressively into the face of the farthest-gone auditor—a
girl preferably—and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to build
itself in the deep hush. When it has reached exactly the right length,
jump suddenly at that girl and yell, “<i>You’ve got it!</i>” If you’ve got the
<i>pause</i> right, she’ll fetch a dear little yelp and spring right out of her
shoes. But you must get the pause right; and you will find it the most
troublesome and aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook.)</p>

<p>The student may give himself fine exercise by choosing any
one of the following moods and writing a one-minute composition
upon it. Then let him read it aloud with the appropriate
tone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Admiration, Appeal, Argument, Comparison, Challenge, Command,
Excitement, Geniality, Solemnity, Reproof, Modesty, Contempt, Encouragement,
Determination, Affection, Pity, Joy, Gloom, Hate,
Friendliness, Aspiration, Warning, Meditation, Horror, Belittlement,
Exultation, Despair, Confusion, Calmness, Indifference, Suspense, Fear,
Awe, Haste.</p>

</div>

<p>A wonderful illustration of “Mood” is afforded in a marvelous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
poem written by Bartholomew Dowling, at one time the
editor of <i>The Mirror</i>, in San Francisco, California. It depicts
the “heroism of despair,” as, perhaps, it was never presented
before or since in all literature. Without commending
the sentiment expressed, the authors give this poem a place in
their volume as an incomparable example, well worthy of prolonged
study, of the power of words to express “mood.” One
of the greatest dramatists the world has ever known used to
read this poem aloud, daily, for years.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW TO READ POETRY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In order to avoid the “singsong” habit, common to so many
while reading poetry, let us remember to make but a very
delicate pause at the end of each line. Of course, if the sense
requires a decided pause, one should not fail to make it.
Browning’s “My Star” is a splendid example of where but a
very slight swelling of the voice is necessary to indicate the
end of each line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All that I know</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of a certain star</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is, it can throw</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(Like the angled spar)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now a dart of red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now a dart of blue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till my friends have said</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They would fain see, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My star that dartles the red and the blue!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What matter to me if their star is a world?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To illustrate the contrary to this let us refer to a few lines
from Riley’s “The South Wind and the Sun,” noting that the
poise of the tone is considerably longer at the end of each line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">And the humming-bird that hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a jewel up among</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">They mesmerized and swung</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the palpitating air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drowsed with odors strange and rare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, with whispered laughter, slipped away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And left him hanging there.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We can hardly overestimate the value of a careful study of
the lyric to the student of expressive speech. It demands
superior powers to render a lyric adequately. Bertha Kuntz
Baker, the great American reader, thus suggestively writes on
this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To clarify the diction, go over the poem, word by word, conform
each word carefully, repeatedly to your ideal of that word, giving the
vowel its fullest possible value, tucking in the consonants as clear,
light envelopes around and between the vowels.</p>

<p>When we think of melody in speech, we immediately think
of the lyric. In form and in spirit it approaches nearest towards
music, for it is “emotion all compact.” When we have
stimulated within us a noble emotion, we begin at once to respond
in some rhythmic action, a beat of our foot, sway of the
body, or humming in a tuneful way. There is melody in prose
as well as in poetry, only it is not so pronounced. Lincoln’s
“Gettysburg Address” is a splendid example of prose-poetry.
We are under obligation to James Raymond Perry in the
<i>North American Review</i> for metrically dividing this oration:</p>

<p>Channing’s “Symphony” is another interesting illustration
of musical prose:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To live content with small means, to seek elegance rather than
luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable;
and wealthy, not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently,
act frankly; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open
heart; to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry
never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow
up through the common. This is to be my symphony.</p>

</div>

<p>The most striking example of all is the following excerpt
taken from Ingersoll’s oration entitled “A Vision of War”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>These heroes are dead. They died for liberty—they died for us.
They are at rest. They sleep in the land they made free, under the
flag they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks,
the tearful willows, and the embracing vines. They sleep beneath the
shadows of the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or of storm, each in
the windowless palace of Rest. Earth may run red with other wars:
they are at peace. In the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they
found the serenity of death. I have one sentiment for soldiers living
and dead: Cheers for the living; tears for the dead.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And not in the full thick, leafy bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the wind can hardly find breathing-room</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Under their tassels,—cattle near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Biting shorter the short green grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a hedge of sumach and sassafras,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With bluebirds twittering all around,—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the light of his adventurous eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flashing with boldest enterprise:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At ten years old he went to sea,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God knoweth if he be living now,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sailed in the good ship <i>Commodore</i>,—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To bring us news, and she never came back.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, ’tis twenty long years and more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since that old ship went out of the bay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With my great-hearted brother on her deck;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I watched him till he shrank to a speck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his face was toward me all the way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright his hair was, a golden brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The time we stood at our mother’s knee:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That beauteous head, if it did go down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Carried sunshine into the sea.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Out in the fields one summer night</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Loitering till after the low little light</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And over the haystack’s pointed top,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">All of a tremble, and ready to drop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first half-hour, the great yellow star</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we with staring, ignorant eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had often and often watched to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Propped and held in its place in the skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the fork of a tall, red mulberry tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which close in the edge of our flax-field grew,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dead at the top—just one branch full</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From which it tenderly shook the dew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over our heads, when we came to play</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In its handbreadth of shadow, day after day:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The other, a bird held fast by the legs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not so big as a straw of wheat:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The berries we gave her she wouldn’t eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But cried and cried, till we held her bill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So slim and shining, to keep her still.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Good Deacon Jones, although a pious man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was not constructed on the meager plan;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he so loved the Sabbath day of rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the seven deemed it far the best;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could he have made the year’s allotment o’er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He would have put in many rest-days more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One Sunday morn, on sacred matters bent,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">This horse he got by trading with a Jew,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He’s in the lead, and Mose is off his feet.”</div>

<h5>THE CHRISTMAS RING</h5>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">May was pretty, plump and pretty, and with such a lovely soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a smile lit up her features like a mental aureole.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">People gazed in admiration—always listened—when she talked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Always made you think of roses, but she limped whene’er she walked.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nothing crippled, nothing shriveled, nothing of the withered sort;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just a perfect human being, save one leg a trifle short;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though nature had intended her the rarest of her kind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But fell short of precious matter and no substitute could find.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair as polished alabaster that had wakened from its dream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But so modest and retiring she held every one’s esteem.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though her imperfection grieved her more than anybody knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet her life was like the heavens when the stars are peeping through.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At first sight of her you’d fancy as you blinked your startled eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You had chanced upon a seraph who had taken human guise:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a man will gaze in wonder at a jewel on the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere he quite believes his senses that a treasure had been found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enter handsome, kindly David: comes a stranger to the place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Searching for the soul of beauty hid behind a maiden face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not among the belles of fashion, not among the aimless kind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could he find the perfect woman he had pictured in his mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thought to find a truer sweetheart in some pretty village lass;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Find his lily of the valley in the higher middle class;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out among the quiet people where his riches were unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some fair maid whose homely virtues would appreciate his own.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was at a social function where he met the charming May</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her sister, Belle, the elder, quite as handsome in her way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May was sunny, sweet and gentle—Belle was haughty and austere;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While ambition strode beside her just a little bit too near.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a gentleman of leisure, David played the friendly rôle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As contented as a youngster when he’s at a sugar-bowl.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">David laid no special favor upon either Belle or May,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he whispered things to Cupid—told him all he had to say.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet he played the gallant nobly, exercising all his art:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hid behind the cunning Cupid he deployed to hide his heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May grew ever more unselfish, giving way to Sister Belle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Dan Cupid felt like starting in a raucous college yell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Belle had been the child of favor—May the daughter of regret;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One the Mount of Delectation, one the Mount of Olivet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a man preferred her sister was to Belle almost absurd:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She took everything for granted—simply waiting David’s word.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Custom bids one ask the parents—though he heed not what they say—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If a lover love a lover love will get her anyway.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So when David sought permission he was just a bit obscure—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which was laid to nervous tension such as lovers must endure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May I win your noblest daughter? Both fond parents gave consent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thinking Belle the one intended—straight to her the father went.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Belle, too vain to hold the secret, poured it in the ears of May:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How the heart grows disappointed when a hope has gone astray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a graduate from college, David had excuse for staying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he gave the pair no inkling of the love-game he was playing.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the summer and the autumn David studied well his art:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Read up Cupid on devotion and the psychics of the heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the Church on Christmas evening David played the Santa Claus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Telling stories to the children; gaining laughter and applause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Handed out the many presents till the tree was stripped and bare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave to Belle a jewel-sunburst which she fastened in her hair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With no special gift from David, May was getting trouble-hearted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But by dint of constant smiling kept the tears from getting started.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the midst of the excitement David cast off his disguise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave a rousing speech of greeting, closing up with this surprise:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Friends, I have an extra present, ’tis the last one on the tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the Queen of Love and Beauty, choice of all the world to me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One with that angelic nature, Heaven only can bestow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with just enough of human to detain her here below.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have read her secret often as the star man reads the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the horoscope got tangled in the flashlight of her eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a love beyond endurance and a wealth beyond control,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have come to claim my sweetheart with the treasures of my soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a symbol of devotion I have brought this solitaire—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my heart is in the girdle and her name is graven there.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All are thrilled with expectation; every neck is craned to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who possesses all these virtues; whom the wonder maid can be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the aisle our David hastened—passing Belle upon the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he paused to place the jewel on the pretty hand of May.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With her bosom over-flowing, May could utter not a word,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But her eyes and lips gave answer in the silence David heard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the tear that sorrow started changing quick to love’s employ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembled on her heavy lashes like a messenger of joy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While her cheek has turned to crimson, down the drop of rapture goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stopping there awhile to glisten like a dewdrop on a rose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can you measure love’s emotion when a sorrow turns to bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a maid whose heart is broken has it mended with a kiss?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is said the first known lovers—and I think they do it yet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As first aid in pressing cases, used their arms as tourniquet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">David kissed her there in public, and he hugged her all he could;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May had half-way hoped he wouldn’t, then she half-way hoped he would.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though they broke a social custom, none was there to make ado,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the pastor’s benediction, <i>just for once, was just for two</i>.</div>

<h5>THE FUNERAL AT PARADISE BAR</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Paul Shoup</span></p>

<p>About four o’clock in the morning, Uncle Hank Witherspoon would
climb up on the box while the sun was tossing a few experimental
shafts of light across the canyon, and, watching with pride and satisfaction
the leaders dancing little dust clouds out of the stage road,
would remark to bystanders who turned up their coat collars and
talked politics to keep warm: “Some men are born hostlers; you see
it by the way they lifts a hoss’s foot; some <i>sabes</i> how to ride, and most
gin’r’lly they overruns their boots’n their spurs is bright; and then
there be others that are fine at hoofin’ it and lambastin’ a pack train
with a rawhide an’ one hundred choice selections from two langidges;
but as for me, my special speci-ality is just plain drivin’ of a stage; a
stage with four hosses; just that and nothin’ more.” With that Uncle
Hank would loosen his whip, the leaders would rear like chargers on a
monument, the wheel horses would gather their feet under them—and
down the road, pitching, swaying, leaving behind them a wall of dust,
would go the famous Mokelumne stage, while half the population of
Paradise Bar—they were early risers in the camp—would stand with
hands in pockets, staring after in silent admiration. Uncle Hank was
wiry and grizzled and storm-beaten; his pointed beard stood out at a
strong angle to his determined nose; his eyes were of a mild and
pleasant blue, but the fire in them awaited only the flint. His laugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
was merry, but he had a voice that would make the most obstreperous
horse remember that he was but as the dust of the earth before this
master.</p>

<p>Uncle Hank was at the helm of the transportation system of Paradise
Bar; he and his stage the connecting link between camp and civilization,
the latter represented by the county seat, Meadow Lark.</p>

<p>Uncle Hank, recognizing his importance in both communities, and
especially in Paradise Bar, was as gracious as an only hope—he was
never forlorn. He was an absolute dictator, it was true; he even decided
the locations of the passengers on the stage, and settled disputes
as to outside and inside. But he was autocratic wisely, and there was
really no reason why he should have been called upon to divide his sovereignty.
Yet, one sad day the Alladin Bonanza Company built a lumber
road down from Paradise Bar to Lone Pine. At Lone Pine the
new road connected with the line of the Gray Eagle Stage Company,
which, as Uncle Hank put it, flopped its way up from Meadow Lark.
So, when the Gray Eagle extended its tri-weekly service from Lone
Pine to Paradise Bar, trouble outcropped on Uncle Hank’s trail at
once. George William Pike, of the Upper Basin, was the driver to
whom Uncle Hank referred as the dry goods clerk who handled the
ribbons for the opposition corporation.</p>

<p>George William surmised here and there and elsewhere, when he
cornered an audience, that the new route was two miles the shorter,
and the grade, calculating ups and downs, at least five per cent better.
The report reached Uncle Hank by air line, of course. He was silent
a little while, and then with elaborate courtesy thanked his informant,
adding that he was greatly obliged, not for the news itself, but because
he had for a long time been trying to recollect the name of the
chap who left Placerville after trying circumstances without advising
his bondsmen. It was indeed strange that a man caught stealing garments
from a poor washerwoman’s clothes line should be directing
horses; remarkably odd, when it was evident that he was cut out for
a Chinaman and not a stage driver. So saying, Uncle Hank awoke
an echo unusually far off, making it jump startled from the hillside
at the crack of his whip, and drove on.</p>

<p>There was some difference of opinion in Paradise Bar concerning
the merits of the two lines; so long as they ran on different days and
at different hours, the question could not be satisfactorily settled, and
the Bright Light kept open an hour later in the evening to permit a
full discussion of the subject—thereby saving shutting up at all. The
real trouble began when the Gray Eagle line, perceiving that Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
Hank continued to carry the larger part of the business, borrowed his
schedule and started to operate upon it with their new yellow coach
with vermillion trimmings and four white horses, to say nothing of
George William Pike with his curled mustache, red necktie and stand-up
collar. He would have worn a silk hat too—the owners of the line
were aristocrats, with ideas and winter residences in Lunnon—but
Morosin’ Jones who squirmed his shoulders and clasped his hands
like an awkward maid of fifteen when he talked, begged him to desist;
he, Morosin’, had such an unconquerable inclination to perforate high
hats with his forty-four wherever they might be. George William
wisely desisted. Uncle Hank’s stage had nothing but a faint recollection
of paint, and was written over with history recorded by bullet
holes; the harness was apt to be patched, and Nebuchadnezzar, the
off leader, was wall-eyed, and his partner, Moloch, sway-backed and
short maned. Of the wheel horses, one was a gray with hoofs that
needed constant paring; the other had the appearance of a whitewashed
house at which mud had been flung with startling effect. Of
the two, Rome and Athens, no god could have decided which was
entitled to the palm of ugliness; but Uncle Hank, who loved them all
with the love a man may have for a homely dog, declared that the
wheel-horses were beauty spots in nature alongside the leaders.</p>

<p>It was a memorable morning on which the two stages left Paradise
Bar together. The yellow stage, with its nickel-plated harness and
white horses and tan-gloved driver, started three minutes first; and
then, as if gathering up his horses and the stage and the reins altogether,
Uncle Hank went down the line. It was a lively experience
for the passengers; bends they went around on two wheels, creeks they
took at a leap, bowlders and ruts only they avoided, and that because
a scientist was using his science. The grade of the other line must
have been at that time very good, for Uncle Hank had been only four
minutes hitched in front of the Elysium Hotel when the other stage
drew up. It was true that he picked his teeth as if he had been in to
lunch, and casually enquired of a passenger, so that George William
might hear, if they had stopped for dinner on the road, or did they
expect to get it at the hotel; whereat the passenger, jolted and jarred
beyond good manners, roared: “Stop for dinner! Great Scott! We
stopped for nothing—bowlders, rivers, landslides and precipices; if his
Satanic Majesty was after us, he found the worst trail he ever traveled—and
I can’t imagine what other reason there could be for such
driving.”</p>

<p>The passenger went into the hotel. George William said something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
below his breath, and Uncle Hank smiled. Alas for vanity! Ever it
goes before a stumble, a broken spring or a sick horse. The stages had
different schedules for the upward trip, but on the next journey downward
disaster overtook Uncle Hank. Seven of the nine hours’ ride
were accomplished, and the stage was at the mouth of the canyon.
Here a point of rock thrusts itself forward, marking a sharp turn in
the road. Around this turn galloped the horses, and twenty feet before
him, sunning itself in the road, Moloch saw an eleven-button rattler.
He knew what that meant, and sat down and slid with all four feet
plowing the mountain road. They stopped short of the snake, that had
coiled and awaited their coming, and then perceiving the enemy otherwise
engaged, had wisely slipped into the manzanitas by the roadside.
Fifteen precious minutes were used in repairing the disaster to the
harness—and the race was lost. That night, for the first time in the
ten years in which he had been the oracle of two communities, Uncle
Hank, instead of telling stories and expounding wisdom for the benefit
of the unenlightened below, went up to his room immediately after
dinner and retired without lighting his candle. George William put on
a new pink necktie and his beloved silk hat, and went about, stepping
high like one of his white horses, but casting wary glances abroad for
the appearance of one Morosin’ Jones, who was coy and fidgety and
could perforate a dollar at one hundred feet.</p>

<p>In Paradise Bar every game was settled by the best two out of three.
Life was too feverish and too short to await three out of five, and it
was against the principles of the camp to leave any questions undecided.
Therefore, it was tacitly understood that the winner of the
next race would be the standard of comparison thereafter in matters
pertaining to travel. Other stage lines would be second-class, ranking
just above a mule train. There was another reason: Paradise Bar
was exceedingly fond of excitement, but it had no mind to risk its
neck in stage racing down the mountain-side forever and ever; precipices
yawned too many invitations. The personal feeling and the betting
both heavily favored Uncle Hank, both gratifying and troubling
to him.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that in the third race, under fair conditions,
Uncle Hank would have won; he would either have won or gone over
a precipice. But Rome, who had never before been known to have
anything the matter with him save an abnormal appetite for grain, fell
slightly lame. All day before the race, Uncle Hank worried over this,
all night he tossed in his blankets, and was only partly relieved the
next day when Rome appeared again to be all right, and ate hay as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
if under the impression that the sun was shining and there was plenty
more being made. The last two days had greatly changed Uncle
Hank; he carried his head so that his beard touched his breast; his
hat was slouched low over his eyes; he kept his hands in his pockets
and spoke in monosyllables. He ate little and had a far-away look in
his blue eyes. He saw his fame departing, his reputation collapsing,
all that a man may build in this life, whether he creates empires or
digs post-holes, crumbling—the reputation of “being onto his job.”</p>

<p>The next morning with the fear of that lameness in his heart, Uncle
Hank hitched up and drove down the main street. He saw the yellow
stage also ready. There was no evidence of lameness in Rome as he
drove up to the door of the express office, nor when the stage stopped
at the Record Nugget for the hotel passengers. Uncle Hank’s despondent
face became more cheerful; he looked older and grayer and
even bent a little that morning, but he climbed up on the box with his
old-time energy. His courage and spirit were never to be doubted;
only that lameness in Rome worried him. He gathered up the lines
and loosened his whip; but the four did not go with their accustomed
dashing display. Instead there was confusion and hesitation; in fifteen
yards the slight lameness of the right wheel horse was apparent,
and Uncle Hank drew up. He dropped the lines, and for a moment
his face was in his hands.</p>

<p>The other stage had gone. Nothing could ever convince the public
satisfactorily, he thought, that after starting he had not given up the
race through fear. The limp was scarcely apparent. He perhaps
would not have noticed it for some miles had it not been for his
haunting dread and the false start. Yet he knew what it would mean
before the level was reached—a steep down grade and he would have
to go walking into Meadow Lark, a loser by an hour.</p>

<p>Uncle Hank, a broken old man, climbed down from the stage.
“Take ’em, George,” he said to the hostler. “There won’t be no stage
down to-day.” He said no more, but passed amid a dead silence along
the road through the population of Paradise Bar which had turned
out to see the beginning of the deciding race. Some guessed at the
reason; and to all it became apparent when the horses were taken
back to the stable and carefully examined. That day Uncle Hank did
not appear, nor the next; So Bob Allen went up to his cabin in the
evening and, receiving no response to his knocking, kicked open the
door and went in. Uncle Hank lay in his bunk, his face to the wall.
To Bob’s expressions of sympathy and encouraging remarks, he made
no reply; they were to him as the expressions engraved on tombstones,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
and but added bitterness now. To his arguments, Uncle Hank
vouchsafed single words in return, and never turned his face from
the wall. From sympathy to argument, from argument he drifted into
bulldozing; alluded to Uncle Hank as a man afraid of things, among
which he specified a large number in language that I will not reproduce;
and when three connected words was the most he could get out
of Uncle Hank even by this, Bob knew the case was desperate, and
retired, defeated.</p>

<p>The friends of Uncle Hank, the entire population of Paradise Bar,
gravely discussed the situation. It was unanimously decided that the
yellow stage should thereafter stop outside of the camp limits, and
Morosin’ Jones publicly announced, his shoulders working up and down
most nervously, that George William would immediately cease from
wearing stand-up collars and red neckties; he would come into camp
with a slouch hat, a flannel shirt and teamster’s warranted-to-wear
gloves—or it was quite likely he would never go out again. This
statement met with the silent approval of the entire assemblage; and
George William, hearing of it, puzzled and bewildered, wisely refrained
from coming into the camp limits at all, but remained by the
stage. He explained in Meadow Lark that Paradise Bar had gone
crazy; and a cheerful miner from that camp acquiesced, but added that
some of the lunatics were not yet corralled, but still straying about; and
said it looking so significantly at George William that the latter went
home and hunted up a flannel shirt at once.</p>

<p>The next morning a committee waited on Uncle Hank, prepared
with arguments that would show him the error of broken-heartedness—the
easiest thing in the world to cure if its victims would but live
to tell us of it. Uncle Hank still lay with his face to the wall, and in
a little while the news was abroad in the camp that Uncle Hank, still
with his face to the wall, had resolutely died. It was a gray day in
Paradise Bar; the melodion in the Red Light was hushed; friends
nodded instead of speaking as they passed by; the camp began to
realize what it had lost. It was determined, as a last mark of the
camp’s esteem for Uncle Hank, to make the journey to the place of
the final tie-up simple but impressive. No formal meeting was held;
the boys just gathered together and acted on a common idea. The
whole camp would be in the procession, and they would go down to
Meadow Lark over the old familiar road. Uncle Hank’s stage carrying
the old stage-driver, would be at the head, of course; then there
was an awkward pause. More than one felt that it would add to the
dignity of the occasion to have two stages, but finally, when Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
Wilkerson arose and suggested that the Gray Eagle stage, carrying
leading citizens, be placed next, there was a murmur of dissent. Then
Bob Allen arose in his place and made the only known speech of
his life:</p>

<p>“Friends, you are on the wrong trail and will hit a blind canyon, certain.
Of course we should have the other stage, and Pike to drive it.
Uncle Hank wasn’t the kind of a man to carry jealousy with him
into camp. ’Twasn’t being beat by Pike that broke Uncle Hank’s
heart; it was partly p’haps being beat at all, and partly, to my way
of thinkin’, because Paradise Bar didn’t stand behind him. That was
the main reason, gentlemen; he just died of pure lonesomeness. When
this yaller ve-hicle comes into camp, does we say to it: ‘You’re purty
and you’re new, and probably your springs is all right and maybe
your road; but you might jest as well pass on. Do you observe this
old stage with its paint wore off and its bullet holes? Do you see that
it’s down a little on one side and some of the spokes is new and some
are old? Do you know that these four old hosses have been whoopin’
her up for Paradise Bar and for nothin’ else these ten years—and a
sunshiny day and one chuck full of snow and sleet was all the same
to them? Be you aware that this is our Uncle Hank, and that he has
been workin’ our lead for us these fifteen years, and never lost a dollar
or a pound of stuff or spilled a passenger, or asked one of the
boys to hoof it because he hadn’t no <i>dinero</i>? Those bullet holes—men
behind masks made ’em, but Uncle Hank never tightened a ribbon
for the whole caboodle. The paint’s been knocked off that stage
in our service, and it’s ours. Therefore, though you be yaller and
handsome, with consid’ble silver plate, we can’t back you against our
own flesh and blood. And that settles it.’ Did we talk that way, boys?
No, we jest stood off and gambled on the result as if Uncle Hank
was a travelin’ stranger ’stead of the best friend we had. We stood
off impartial like and invited the white hoss outfit to git in and win
if it could. And now, gentlemen, have we got the nerve to dynamite
this opposition stage line, when the whole gang of us ought to be
blown sky high?</p>

<p>“Uncle Hank wouldn’t have had it so. He didn’t cherish any ill
feeling pussonly against anybody; whatever he said was because they
was takin’ away from him what he had worked all his life for. He
wasn’t jealous of George William, but of him as a stage driver, because
we made him so. Boys, he loved us and was mighty proud of
our regard—and we didn’t show it in the time of trial. And he’s gone
over the great divide with tears in his eyes, and we are to blame.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
Who among any of us poor fools has a right to say that the other
stage shouldn’t follow?”</p>

<p>Bob sat down amid absolute silence, wiping his face vigorously.
Major Wilkerson rose to his feet. “I renew my suggestion,” said he,
“that we have the Gray Eagle stage. I think you’ll all agree that
Bob’s right.”</p>

<p>Morosin’ Jones rose from his stump, suffused with emotion. “In
course he’s right,” he said, huskily, “but the stage ou’t to be painted
black.” A murmur of assent greeted this speech.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The day was beautiful. The procession went slowly down the old
stage road, past Lime Point, through the Roaring River canyon, beyond
up Reddy’s grade, over the First Summit and then through Little
Forest to the watering-place at the head of the last canyon. Every
stream, every tree, every rock along the road was known to Uncle
Hank. He was going home over a familiar way. The pine trees,
with their somber green, were silent; the little streams that went
frolicking from one side of a canyon to another seemed subdued; it
was spring, but the gray squirrels were not barking in the tree-tops,
and the quail seemed to pipe but faintly through the underbrush. The
lupines and the bluebells nodded along the way; the chipmunks stood
in the sunlight and stared curiously.</p>

<p>All would have gone well had not George William Pike been a man
without understanding—and such a man is beyond redemption. He
did not appreciate the spirit of the invitation to join in this last simple
ceremony in honor of Uncle Hank. He accepted it as an apology
from Paradise Bar and growled to himself because of the absurd
request to paint the coach black—which he would not have done except
for an order from the superintendent, who was a man of policy.
A year could have been wasted in explaining that the invitation was
an expression of humility and of atonement for the camp’s treatment
of its own. So he came and wore his silk hat and his red necktie,
and Morosin’ Jones almost had a spasm in restraining himself.</p>

<p>Down the mountain-side they went, slowly and decorously. Nothing
eventful happened until the mouth of the canyon was cleared, and
then George William became impatient. He could not understand the
spirit of the occasion. Meadow Lark and supper were a long way off,
and the luncheon at Half-Way House had been light. So he began
making remarks over his horses’ heads with the intention of hurrying
up Gregg, who was driving the old stage. “Well fitted for this kind
of work, those horses, ain’t they?” he said. “Seems curious they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
ever put on the stage.” Gregg said nothing, but tightened rein a bit.
“Where will we stop for the night?” asked George William presently,
flicking the off leader’s ear with his whip.</p>

<p>Gregg turned around angrily. “If you don’t like the way this thing
is bein’ done, you can cut and go on in town alone; but if you don’t
keep your mouth closed there’ll be trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go into town alone,” rejoined George William
pleasantly, “but I reckon we’d go in better fashion if we was at the
head of this percession.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d better try it,” said Gregg, reddening, and thereupon
George William turned out his four white horses and his black stage,
without saying anything to his two passengers, and proceeded to go
around. Gregg gathered in the slack in his reins. “Go back!” he
roared. But Pike, swinging wide to the right to avoid the far-reaching
whip, went on. Nebuchadnezzar pricked up his ears. Rome looked
inquiringly at Athens, and Moloch snorted indignantly. Athens’ expression
said very plainly: “Are we at our time of life going to permit
four drawing-room apologies for horses and a new-fangled rattletrap
to pass us on our own road?” The negative response could
be seen in the quiver that ran down each horse’s back. The leaders
gently secured their bits between their teeth. So absorbed was Gregg
in the strange actions of George William that he paid little attention
to his own horses.</p>

<p>Up and down the line behind him men were waving and gesticulating
and shouting. “Don’t let him pass you!” yelled Wilkerson. That
instruction ran up and down the line, clothed in a variety of picturesque
and forcible utterances. But no instruction was needed by
the horses in front of Gregg. They understood, and scarcely had the
other stage turned into the main road ahead when they at one jump
broke from a walk into a gallop. George William saw and gave his
four the rein and the whip. Glancing back, Gregg watched the whole
procession change from a line of decorous dignity to one of active
excitement. Dust began to rise, men on horseback passed men on
mules; men in buckboards passed men on lumber wagons. George
William held the road, and with it a great advantage. To pass him
it would be necessary to go out among the rocks and the sage-brush,
and the white four were racing swiftly, rolling out behind them a
blinding cloud of dust. Gregg set his teeth, and spoke encouragingly
to his horses. George William turned and shouted back an insult:
“You needn’t hurry; we’ll tell them you’ll be there to-morrow. ’Tend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
to your new business; there is nothing in the other for you. We’re
going into town first.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Gregg grimly—and loosened his whip. The four
lifted themselves together at its crack; in another half mile they were
ready to turn out to go around. Gregg watched for a place anxiously.
Brush and boulders seemed everywhere, but finally he chose a little
sandy wash along which ran the road for a way.</p>

<p>Turning out he went into the sand and lost ten yards. He heard
George William laugh sarcastically. But the old stage horses had been
in sand before, and had but one passenger besides their driver. In a
little while they were abreast the leaders, and here they stayed and
could gain no farther. For George William laid on the lash, and the
road was good. On they went, the one stage running smoothly on
the hard road, the other swaying, bounding, rocking, among the rocks
and gullies. A little while they ran thus, and then the road began
to tell. Pike shouted triumphantly. Gregg, with despair in his heart,
watched with grief the loss of inch after inch. “What can I do?”
he groaned—and turning, he found himself face to face with Uncle
Hank. The reins dropped from his nerveless hands, and his face went
white.</p>

<p>“Give me a hand!” shouted Uncle Hank, and over the swinging door
he crawled on the seat—and Gregg perceived he was flesh and blood.
The old fire was in his eyes, he stood erect and loosened his whip
with his left hand easily as of yore. And then something else happened.
The line behind was scattered and strung out to perhaps a
mile in length, but every eye was on the racing coaches. They saw
the familiar figure of the old stage driver, saw him gather up the
reins; saw and understood that he had come back to life again, and
up and down that line went a cheer such as Paradise Bar will seldom
hear again. Uncle Hank sent the whip waving over the backs of his
beloved. “Nebuchadnezzar! Moloch! Rome! Athens! Come! No
loafing now. This is our road, our stage—and our camp is shouting.
Don’t you hear the boys! Ten years together, you’n me. Whose dust
have we taken? Answer me! Good, Athens, good—steady, Rome,
you blessed whirlwind. Reach out, Neb—that’s it—reach. Easy, Moloch,
easy; never mind the rocks. Yo-ho! Yo-ho-o-o! In we go!”</p>

<p>At the first words of the master, the four lifted themselves as if
inspired. Then they stretched lowly and ran; ran because they knew
as only horses can know; ran as his voice ran, strong and straight.
In three minutes they turned in ahead of the white horses and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
funeral stage. The race was practically won. Uncle Hank with the
hilarious Gregg alongside, drove into Meadow Lark ten minutes ahead
of all others—and Meadow Lark in its astonishment almost stampeded.
After a while the rest of Paradise Bar arrived, two of its leading
citizens, who had started out in a certain black stage drawn by four
horses, coming in on foot. They were quite non-committal in their
remarks, but it was inferred from a few words dropped casually that,
after the stage stopped, they lost some time in chasing the driver back
into the foothills; and it was observed that they were quite gloomy
over their failure to capture him.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” said Morosin’ Jones, in an ecstasy of joy. “What’s
the good of cherishin’ animosity? Why, for all I care he kin wear
that red necktie now if he wants to”—then after a pause—“yes, and
the silk hat, too, if he’s bound to be a cabby.”</p>

<p>Uncle Hank was smiling and shaking hands with everybody and
explaining how the familiar motion of the stage had brought him out
of his trance. “I’m awful glad to have you here, boys; mighty glad
to see you. The hosses and me are proud. I’ll admit it. We
oughter be. Ain’t Paradise Bar with us, and didn’t we win two out
of three, after all?”—From <i>The Black Cat</i>, June, 1902, copyright by

<h5>PARODY ON “THAT HEATHEN CHINEE”</h5>

<p>[The following remarkable parody was written by the Reverend
Father Wood, Professor of English Literature at St. Ignatius College,
San Francisco. For the annual exercises of his class, a debate was to
be held as to the respective abilities of the various authors and poets
studied during the year. Each had his advocates and strenuous adherents.
The final test adopted was that each adherent should write out
Bret Harte’s <i>Heathen Chinee</i> in the form his favorite author would
have followed. These verses are after the style of Samuel Lover, the
Irish poet.]</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">By the shores of the sounding sea.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They say he was mad, but the world was mad,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The soul of her lover free.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the days gone by, in the wreck of things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the wave of Life’s wide sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They were carried beyond by their kinsmen high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He and his Annabel Lee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her heart was pure, too pure for the world</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That chills the heart of the free—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his was a life that chilled with the life</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That passed from Annabel Lee.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the angels are good; in heaven above</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They gather the wrecks of the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They gather the gold from the wrecks of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the soul in its purity free—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So this is what they’ve done with the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of Poe and his Annabel Lee.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ve stood in the room where they lived and loved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And my soul touched the Life to be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I felt the spell of the hidden light</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That lived in Annabel Lee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I felt the hand of the man she loved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(That she loved far better than we,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And down in my soul the double soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Awoke the God in me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So down in my dreams I follow the beams</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">That flashes and quivers to me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away in the years where the Future stands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the world that is to be,</div>

<h5>DORA</h5>

<p>With farmer Allan, at the farm, abode William and Dora. William
was his son, and she his niece. He often looked at them and thought,
“I’ll make them man and wife.” Now Dora felt her uncle’s will in
all, and yearned towards William; but the youth, because he had always
been with her in the house, thought not of Dora.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when Allan called his son, and said, “My
son, I married late, but I wish to see my grandchild on my knees
before I die: and I have set my heart upon a match. Now therefore
look to Dora; she is well to look at, thrifty too beyond her age. She
is my brother’s daughter: he and I had once hard words, and parted,
and he died in foreign lands; but for his sake I cared for his daughter
Dora: take her for your wife; for I have wished this marriage, night
and day, for many years.”</p>

<p>But William answered short: “I cannot marry Dora; by my life, I
will not marry Dora.”</p>

<p>Then the old man was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:
“You will not, boy! You dare to answer thus? But in my time a
father’s word was law, and so it shall be now for you. Look to it;
consider, William: take a month to think, and let me have an answer
to my wish, or by the Lord that made me, you shall pack, and never
more darken my doors again.”</p>

<p>But William answered madly; bit his lips, and broke away. The
more he looked at her the less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
but Dora bore them meekly. Then, before the month was out he left
his father’s house, and hired himself to work within the fields; and,
half in love, half spite, he wooed and wed a laborer’s daughter, Mary
Morrison.</p>

<p>When the wedding bells were ringing, Allan called his niece and
said: “My girl, I love you well; but if you speak with him who was
my son, or change a word with her he calls his wife, my home is none
of yours. My will is law.” And Dora promised, being meek. She
thought, “It cannot be: my uncle’s mind will change!” And days went
on, and there was born a boy to William; then distresses came on him,
and day by day he passed his father’s gate, heart-broken, and his father
helped him not. But Dora stored what little she could save, and sent
it them by stealth, nor did they know who sent it; till at last a fever
seized on William, and in harvest time he died. Then Dora went to
Mary. Mary sat and looked with tears upon her boy, and thought
hard things of Dora. Dora came and said: “I have obeyed my uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
until now, and I have sinned, for it was all through me this evil came
on William at the first. But, Mary, for the sake of him that’s gone,
and for your sake, the woman that he chose, and for this orphan, I
am come to you. You know there has not been for these five years so
full a harvest: let me take the boy, and I will set him in my uncle’s
eye among the wheat; that when his heart is glad of the full harvest,
he may see the boy, and bless him for the sake of him that’s gone.”
And Dora took the child and went her way across the wheat, and sat
upon a mound that was unsown, where many poppies grew. Far off
the farmer came into the field and spied her not; for none of all his
men dare tell him Dora waited with the child. And Dora would have
risen and gone to him, but her heart failed her; and the reapers reaped,
and the sun fell, and all the land was dark.</p>

<p>But when the morrow came, she rose and took the child once more,
and sat upon the mound; and made a little wreath of all the flowers
that grew about, and tied it round his hat to make him pleasing in her
uncle’s eye. Then when the farmer passed into the field he spied her,
and he left his men at work, and came and said: “Where were you
yesterday? Whose child is that? What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground, and answered softly, “This
is William’s child!”</p>

<p>“And did I not,” said Allan, “did I not forbid you, Dora?”</p>

<p>Dora said again: “Do with me as you will, but take the child, and
bless him for the sake of him that’s gone!”</p>

<p>And Allan said, “I see it is a trick got up betwixt you and the woman
there. I must be taught my duty, and by you! You knew my word
was law, and yet you dared to slight it. Well!—for I will take the
boy; but go you hence, and never see me more.”</p>

<p>So saying he took the boy that cried aloud and struggled hard. The
wreath of flowers fell at Dora’s feet. She bowed over her hands, and
the boy’s cry came to her from the field, more and more distant. She
bowed down her head, remembering the day when first she came, and
all the things that had been. She bowed down and wept in secret;
and the reapers reaped, and the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
Then Dora went to Mary’s house, and stood upon the threshold. Mary
saw the boy was not with Dora. She broke out in praise to God, that
helped her in her widowhood. And Dora said, “My uncle took the
boy; but, Mary, let me live and work with you; he says that he will
never see me more.”</p>

<p>Then answered Mary, “This shall never be, that thou shouldst take
my trouble on thyself: and, now I think, he shall not have the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
for he will teach him hardness, and to slight his mother; therefore
thou and I will go, and I will have my boy, and bring him home; and
I will beg of him to take thee back: but if he will not take thee back
again, then thou and I will live within one house, and work for William’s
child, until he grows of age to help us.”</p>

<p>So the women kissed each other, and set out, and reached the farm.
The door was off the latch: they peeped and saw the boy set up betwixt
his grandsire’s knees, who thrust him in the hollows of his arms,
and clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks, like one that loved him:
and the lad stretched out and babbled for the golden seal that hung
from Allan’s watch, and sparkled by the fire. Then they came in: but
when the boy beheld his mother, he cried out to come to her: and
Allan set him down, and Mary said: “O Father!—if you let me call
you so—I never came a-begging for myself, or William, or this child;
but now I come for Dora: take her back, she loves you well. O Sir,
when William died, he died at peace with all men; for I asked him,
and he said he could not ever rue his marrying me—I had been a
patient wife: but, Sir, he said that he was wrong to cross his father
thus: ‘God bless him!’ he said, ‘and may he never know the troubles I
have gone through!’ Then he turned his face and passed—unhappy
that I am! But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you will make him
hard, and he will learn to slight his father’s memory; and take Dora
back, and let all be as it was before.”</p>

<p>So Mary said, and Dora hid her face by Mary. There was silence
in the room; and all at once the old man burst in sobs: “I have been
to blame—to blame. I have killed my son. I have killed him—but I
loved him—my dear son. May God forgive me! I have been to
blame. Kiss me, my children.”</p>

<p>Then they clung about the old man’s neck, and they kissed him many
times. And Allan was broken with remorse; and all his love came
back a hundred-fold; and for three hours he sobbed o’er William’s
child thinking of William. So those four abode in one house together;
and as years went forward, Mary took another mate; but Dora lived
unmarried until her death.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Lying dead and cold before him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his bursting heart within him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uttered such a cry of anguish,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the forest moaned and shuddered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the very stars in heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shook and trembled with his anguish.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then he sat down, still and speechless,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the bed of Minnehaha,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the feet of Laughing Water,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At those willing feet, that never</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Never more would lightly follow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With both hands his face he covered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seven long days and nights he sat there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if in a swoon he sat there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speechless, motionless, unconscious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the daylight or the darkness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then they buried Minnehaha;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wrapped her in her robes of ermine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Covered her with snow, like ermine;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Might not leave her in the darkness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Farewell,” said he, “Minnehaha!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Calm as a warrior in a dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our fallen comrade lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His limbs were cold, his sightless eyes</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet stars that rose in memory’s skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To light him o’er death’s sea.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then honored be the soldier’s life,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Like feeble stars on that Christmas eve</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And the long gray lash of the hissing rain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The night fell black and the wild gale played</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the chimney’s throat a shrill, weird tune,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The waters slept and the raindrops clung</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A splintered mast and a tattered sail</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The roaring camp-fire, with rude humor, painted</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The ruddy tints of health</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On haggard face and form that drooped and fainted</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the fierce race for wealth;</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Till one arose, and from his pack’s scant treasure</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A hoarded volume drew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To hear the tale anew.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, while round them shadows gathered faster,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fir-trees, gathering closer in the shadows,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

<h5>WHEN THE OLD MAN DREAMED</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By A. J. Waterhouse</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes ’long after supper my grandsire used to sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the sunbeams through the window things of beauty liked to knit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he’d light his pipe and sit there in a sort of waking dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While to bathe his form in glory seemed the sunlight’s pretty scheme;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, whatever happened, he didn’t seem to see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a smile lit up his features that used to puzzle me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I would often wonder what pleasant inner theme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had caused that strange and tranquil smile when grandpa used to dream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes, though, when I’d listen I’d hear the good man sigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And once I’m almost sure I saw the moisture in his eye,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But whether he would smile or sigh, he didn’t seem to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The things that happened ’round him, and that’s what puzzled me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the wreaths of smoke ascending as the twilight gathered there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shadows crept about him in the old arm chair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And through the evening darkness I could see the fitful gleam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the embers in his lighted pipe when grandpa used to dream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I used to wonder in those days. I wonder now no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For now I understand the thing that puzzled me of yore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I know that through the twilight and the shadows gathering fast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came unto my grandsire, dreaming, the visions of the past.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boys who played with him were there within that little room;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mother’s smile no doubt lit up the darkness and the gloom;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again he ran and leaped and played beside an Eastern stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ones he loved were there, I know, when grandpa used to dream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And so he smiled—and then she stood, his dearest, at his side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the glow of youth upon her, red-lipped and laughing eyed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he told the old, sweet story, and she listened, nothing loth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dreams of hope were written in the happy hearts of both;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, by strange transition, he saw her pulseless lie—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ’twas then I viewed the moisture in the corner of his eye.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old friends were gathered round him, though they’d crossed death’s mystic stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that hour of smiles and sighing when my grandsire used to dream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, glad, sad gift of memory to call our dear ones back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And win them from their narrow homes to Time’s still beaten track!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yours was the power my grandsire held while twilight turned to night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through you his loved returned again and blessed his longing sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I no longer wonder, when his dreaming I recall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At smiles and sighs succeeding while the shadows hid us all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, while my pencil’s trailing and I’ve half forgot my theme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, too, am seeing visions, as my grandsire used to dream.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Then the old man seeks his arm-chair,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And how he used to lead her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the merry dances maze;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How he called her “little princess.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, to please her, used to twine</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To the feebly trembling lip,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">It falls gently at his side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his head bends lower and lower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till his chin lies on his breast,</div>

<h5>PAULINE PAVLOVNA</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By T. B. Aldrich</span></p>

<p>(<i>Scene: Petrograd. Period: The present time. A ballroom in
the winter palace of the prince. The ladies in character costumes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
and masks. The gentlemen in official dress and unmasked, with the
exception of six tall figures in scarlet kaftans, who are treated with
marked distinction as they move here and there among the promenaders.</i></p>

<p><i>Quadrille music throughout the dialogue. Count Sergius Pavlovich
Panshine, who has just arrived, is standing anxiously in the doorway
of an antechamber with his eyes fixed upon a lady in the costume of a
maid of honor in the time of Catherine II. The lady presently disengages
herself from the crowd, and passes near Count Panshine, who
impulsively takes her by the hand and leads her across the threshold of
the inner apartment, which is unoccupied.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Pauline!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You knew me?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> How could I have failed? A mask may hide your features, not
your soul. There’s an air about you like the air that folds a
star. A blind man knows the night, and feels the constellations.
No coarse sense of eye or ear had made you plain to me.
Through these I had not found you; for your eyes, as blue as
violets of our Novgorod, look black behind your mask there, and
your voice—I had not known that either. My heart said, “Pauline
Pavlovna.”</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Ah, your heart said that? You trust your heart then! ’Tis a
serious risk! How is it you and others wear no mask?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> The Emperor’s orders.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Is the Emperor here? I have not seen him.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">May be the Tsar; yet none know which is he.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even his counterparts are left in doubt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unhappy Russia! No serf ever wore such chains</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Environ’d me about, and howled in mine ears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hearken to me, while I reveal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dashing ride of Jennie McNeal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On a spot as pretty as might be found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the dangerous length of the Neutral Ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a cottage cosy, and all their own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She and her mother lived alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safe were the two, with their frugal store,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From all of the many who passed their door;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">One night, when the sun had crept to bed,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And sent their surly drops for proof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To drum a tune on the cottage roof,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close after a knock at the outer door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There entered a dozen dragoons or more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their red coats, stained by the muddy road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That they were British soldiers showed;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The captain his hostess bent to greet,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We will pay you well, and, if may be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then we must dash ten miles ahead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To catch a rebel colonel abed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is visiting home, as doth appear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will make his pleasure cost him dear.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they fell on the hasty supper with zeal,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With never a thought or a moment more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bare-headed she slipped from the cottage door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ran out where the horses were left to feed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unhitched and mounted the captain’s steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And down the hilly and rock-strewn way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She urged the fiery horse of gray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around her slender and cloakless form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Secure and tight, a gloveless hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grasped the reins with stern command;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And full and black her long hair streamed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whenever the ragged lightning gleamed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on she rushed for the colonel’s weal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave, lioness-hearted Jennie McNeal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark! from the hills, a moment mute,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And a cry from the foremost trooper said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Halt! or your blood be on your head!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She heeded it not, and not in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She lashed the horse with the bridle-rein.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So into the night the gray horse strode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His shoes hewed fire from the rocky road;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the high-born courage that never dies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flashed from his rider’s coal-black eyes.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pebbles flew from the fearful race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rain-drops grasped at her glowing face.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“On, on, brave beast!” with loud appeal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cried eager, resolute Jennie McNeal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Halt!” once more came the voice of dread;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Halt! or your blood be on your head!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, no one answering to the calls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sped after her a volley of balls.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They passed her in her rapid flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They screamed to her left, they screamed to her right;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, rushing still o’er the slippery track,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She sent no token of answer back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Except a silvery laughter-peal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave, merry-hearted Jennie McNeal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So on she rushed, at her own good will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through wood and valley, o’er plain and hill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gray horse did his duty well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till all at once he stumbled and fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Himself escaping the nets of harm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But flinging the girl with a broken arm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still undismayed by the numbing pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She clung to the horse’s bridle-rein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gently bidding him to stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Petted him with her able hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sprang again to the saddle-bow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shouted, “One more trial now!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if ashamed of the heedless fall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He gathered his strength once more for all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, galloping down a hillside steep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gained on the troopers at every leap.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No more the high-bred steed did reel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ran his best for Jennie McNeal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They were a furlong behind, or more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the girl burst through the colonel’s door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her poor arm helpless, hanging with pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she all drabbled and drenched with rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But her cheeks as red as fire-brands are,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her eyes as bright as a blazing star,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shouted, “Quick! be quick, I say!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They come! they come! Away! away!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sank on the rude white floor of deal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor, brave, exhausted Jennie McNeal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The startled colonel sprang, and pressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wife and children to his breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turned away from his fireside bright;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And glided into the stormy night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then soon and safely made his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To where the patriot army lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But first he bent, in the dim firelight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kissed the forehead broad and white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And blessed the girl who had ridden so well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To keep him out of a prison-cell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The girl roused up at the martial din,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just as the troopers came rushing in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laughed, e’en in the midst of a moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saying, “Good sirs, your bird has flown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis I who have scared him from his nest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So deal with me now as you think best.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the grand captain bowed, and said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Never you hold a moment’s dread.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of womankind I must crown you queen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So brave a girl I have never seen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wear this gold ring as your valor’s due;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when peace comes I will come for you.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Jennie’s face an arch smile wore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As she said, “There’s a lad in Putnam’s Corps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who told me the same, long time ago;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You two would never agree, I know.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I promised my love to be true as steel,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said good, sure-hearted Jennie McNeal.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The wind was a nor’wester, blowing squally off the sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ’twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we gave her the maintops’l, and stood by to go about.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and the North;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All day we hauled the frozen sheets, and got no further forth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All day as cold as charity, in bitter pain and dread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For very life and nature we tacked from head to head.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We gave the South a wider berth, for there the tide-race roared;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So’s we saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his eye.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The good red fires were burning bright in every ’longshore home;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The windows sparkled clear, and the chimneys volleyed out;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it’s just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day of our adversity was blessed Christmas morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the house above the coastguard’s was the house where I was born.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My mother’s silver spectacles, my father’s silver hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And O the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessed Christmas Day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“All hands to loose topgallant sails,” I heard the captain call.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“By the Lord, she’ll never stand it,” our first mate, Jackson, cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... “It’s the one way or the other, Mr. Jackson,” he replied.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the winter’s day was ending, in the entry of the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So Lord Howard pass’d away with five ships of war that day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Very carefully and slow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Men of Bideford in Devon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we laid them on the ballast down below;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For we brought them all aboard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the thumb-screw and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he sailed away from Flores ’til the Spaniard came in sight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Shall we fight or shall we fly?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good Sir Richard, tell us now,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There’ll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Sir Richard said again: “We be all good Englishmen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I never turn’d my back upon Don or devil yet.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Richard spoke and he laugh’d and we roar’d a hurrah, and so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The little <i>Revenge</i> ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the little <i>Revenge</i> ran on through the long sea-lane between.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thousands of their soldiers look’d down from their decks and laugh’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Running on and on, till delay’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By their mountain-like <i>San Philip</i> that, of fifteen hundred tons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took the breath from our sails, and we stay’d.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And while now the great <i>San Philip</i> hung above us like a cloud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence the thunderbolt will fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long and loud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four galleons drew away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the Spanish fleet that day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the battle-thunder broke from them all.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But anon the great <i>San Philip</i>, she bethought herself and went,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a dozen times we shook ’em off as a dog that shakes his ears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he leaps from the water to the land.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and shame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For some were sunk and many were shatter’d, and so could fight us no more—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For he said, “Fight on! fight on!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tho’ his vessel was all but a wreck;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he said, “Fight on! fight on!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But they dared not touch us again, for they fear’d that we still could sting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So they watch’d what the end would be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we had not fought them in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in perilous plight we were,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the half of the rest of us maim’d for life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We have fought such a fight for a day and a night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As may never be fought again!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have won great glory, my men!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a day less or more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At sea or ashore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We die—does it matter when?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sink me the ship, Master Gunner—sink her, split her in twain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the gunner said, “Ay, ay,” but the seamen made reply:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We have children, we have wives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Lord hath spared our lives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a joyful spirit I, Sir Richard Grenville, die!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he fell upon their decks, and he died.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But they sank his body with honor down into the deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they mann’d the <i>Revenge</i> with a swarthier alien crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And away she sailed with her loss and long’d for her own;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a wind from the lands they had ruin’d awoke from sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter’d navy of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the little <i>Revenge</i> herself went down by the island crags</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be lost evermore in the main.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he has lifted the Colonel’s mare that is the Colonel’s pride.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has lifted her out of the stable door between the dawn and the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then up and spoke the Colonel’s son that led a troop of the Guides:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“If ye know the track of the morning mist, ye know where his pickets are.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At dusk he harries the Abazai—at dawn he is into Bonair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the favor of God, ye may cut him off ere he win the tongue of Jagai.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if he be passed the tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the length and breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal’s men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Colonel’s son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the mouth of a bell, and the heart of hell, and the head of a gallows-tree.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Colonel’s son to the Fort has won; they bid him stay to eat—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he was aware of his father’s mare, with Kamal upon her back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye shoot like a soldier,” Kamal said. “Show now if ye can ride.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s up and over the tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dun he leaned against the bit, and slugged his head above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the red mare played with the snaffle bars like a maiden plays with her love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick, though never a man was seen.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new roused fawn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dun he fell at a water-course—in a woeful heap fell he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He has knocked the pistol out of his hand—small room was there to strive—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Twas only by favor of mine,” quoth he, “ye rode so long alive:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I had raised my bridle-hand as I have carried it low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lightly answered the Colonel’s son: “Do good to bird and beast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But count who comes for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Belike the price of a jackal’s meal were more than a thief could pay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered grain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me my father’s mare again, and I’ll fight my own way back!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“No talk shall be of dogs,” said he, “when wolf and gray wolf meet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lightly answered the Colonel’s son: “I hold by the blood of my clan:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take up the mare for my father’s gift—by God she has carried a man!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The red mare ran to the Colonel’s son, and nuzzled against his breast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We be two strong men,” said Kamal then, “but she loveth the younger best.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall she go with a lifter’s dower, my turquoise-studded rein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Colonel’s son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye have taken the one from a foe,” said he; “will ye take the mate from a friend?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“A gift for a gift,” said Kamal straight; “a limb for the risk of a limb.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy father hath sent his son to me—I’ll send my son to him!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain crest—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He trod the links like a buck in Spring, and he looked a lance in rest.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now here is thy master,” Kamal said, “who leads a troop of the Guides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou must ride at his left side, as shield on shoulder rides.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till death or I cut loose the tie at camp, and board and bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy life is his—thy fate to guard him with thy head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So thou must eat the White Queen’s meat, and all her foes are thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou must harry thy father’s hold for the peace at the Borderline;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Belike they will raise thee to Rassaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the wond’rous Names of God.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Colonel’s son he rides the mare, and Kamal’s boy the dun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when they drew to the quarter-guard, full twenty swords flew clear—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha’ done! ha’ done!” said the Colonel’s son. “Put up the steel at your sides!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Last night ye had struck at a Border thief—to-night ’tis a man of the Guides.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>

<h5>SONG OF THE MYSTIC</h5>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I walk down the Valley of Silence—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Down the dim, voiceless valley—alone!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I hear not the fall of a footstep</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Around me, save God’s and my own;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the hush of my heart is as holy</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As hovers where angels have flown!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Long ago was I weary of voices</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose music my heart could not win;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long ago was I weary of noises</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That fretted my soul with their din;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long ago was I weary of places</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where I met but the human—and sin.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I walked in the world with the worldly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I craved what the world never gave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I said: “In the world each Ideal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That shines like a star on life’s wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is wrecked on the shores of the Real,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And sleeps like a dream in a grave.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And still did I pine for the Perfect,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And still found the False with the True;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I sought ’mid the Human for Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But caught a mere glimpse of its Blue:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I wept when the clouds of the Mortal</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Veiled even that glimpse from my view.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And I toiled on, heart-tired of the Human,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I moaned ’mid the mazes of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till I knelt, long ago, at an altar</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I heard a voice call me. Since then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I walk down the Valley of Silence</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That lies far beyond mortal ken.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do you ask what I found in the Valley?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Tis my Trysting-Place with the Divine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I fell at the feet of the Holy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And above me a voice said: “Be mine.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there rose from the depths of my spirit</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">An echo—“My heart shall be thine.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do you ask how I live in the Valley?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I weep—and I dream—and I pray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But my tears are as sweet as the dew-drops</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That fall on the roses in May;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my prayer, like a perfume from Censers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ascendeth to God night and day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hush of the Valley of Silence</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I dream all the songs that I sing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the music floats down the dim Valley,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till each finds a word for a wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That to hearts, like the Dove of the Deluge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A message of Peace they may bring.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But far on the deep there are billows</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That never shall break on the beach;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I have heard songs in the Silence</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That never shall float into speech;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I have had dreams in the Valley</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Too lofty for language to reach.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And I have seen Thoughts in the Valley—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ah me! how my spirit was stirred!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they wear holy veils on their faces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their footsteps can scarcely be heard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They pass through the Valley like Virgins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Too pure for the touch of a word!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do you ask me the place of the Valley,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ye hearts that are harrowed by Care?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It lieth afar between mountains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And God and His angels are there:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one is the dark mount of Sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And one the bright mountain of Prayer.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I have lived since then, in calm and strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full fifty summers a rover’s life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With wealth to spend, and a power to range,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But never have sought or sighed for change,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death, whenever he comes to me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall come on the wide, unbounded sea!</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By William Bansman</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There are beautiful thoughts in the day-dreams of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When youth and ambition join hands for the strife;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are joys for the gay, which come crowding apace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hang out the rainbow of hope for the race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are prizes to gain, which ascend as we climb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the struggle to win them makes effort sublime.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each cloud that arises has fingers of gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inviting the timid and nerving the bold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each sorrow is tempered with something of sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the crag, while it frowns, shows a niche for the feet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are charms in the verdure which nature has spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sky shows a glory of stars overhead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the zephyrs of summer have voices to woo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well as to bear the perfumes from the dew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are gushes of transport in dreams of the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When memory garners its thoughts of delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the soul seeks its kindred, and noiselessly speaks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the smiles and the blushes of health-blooming cheeks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are rapturous melodies filling the heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With emotions which nothing beside could impart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet, though this cumulous picture may show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The brightest of joys which ambition would know—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though the heaven it opens is one of surprise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All gorgeous with hope, and prismatic with dyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Satiety follows these transports of bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the heart asks a lodgment more real than this;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the dove, it will wander, and still, like the dove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come back, till it rests upon something to love.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The little cares that fretted me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I lost them yesterday</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Among the winds at play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the lowing of the herds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The rustling of the trees,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The humming of the bees.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The foolish fears of what may happen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I cast them all away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the clover-scented grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Among the new-mown hay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the husking of the corn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where drowsy poppies nod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where ill thoughts die and good are born,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Out in the fields with God.</div>

<h5>BROTHERHOOD</h5>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The crest and crowning of all good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life’s final star, is Brotherhood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it will bring again to Earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her long-lost Poesy and Mirth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will send new light on every face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A kingly power upon the race.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And till it come, we men are slaves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And travel downward to the dust of graves.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, clear the way, then, clear the way:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blind creeds and kings have had their day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Break the dead branches from the path:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hope is in the aftermath—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hope is in heroic men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Star-led to build the world again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To this Event the ages ran:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make way for Brotherhood—make way for Man.</div>

<h5>MORNING</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Edward Rowland Sill</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I entered once, at break of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A chapel, lichen-stained and gray,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where a congregation dozed and heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An old monk read from a written Word.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No light through the window-panes could pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For shutters were closed on the rich stained glass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in a gloom like the nether night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The monk read on by a taper’s light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ghostly with shadows that shrunk and grew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the dim light flared on aisle and pew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the congregation that dozed around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listened without a stir or sound—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save one, who rose with wistful face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shifted a shutter from its place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then light flashed in like a flashing gem—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For dawn had come unknown to them—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a slender beam, like a lance of gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shot to the crimson curtain-fold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the bended head of him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who pored and pored by the taper dim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I wondered that, under the morning ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When night and shadow were scattered away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The monk should bow his locks of white</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By a taper’s feebly flickering light—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should pore and pore, and never seem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To notice the golden morning beam.</div>

<h5>THE PETRIFIED FERN</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In a valley, centuries ago,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Grew a little fern leaf, green and slender,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Veining delicate and fibers tender;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waving when the wind crept down so low.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rushes tall, and moss, and grass grew ’round it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Playful sunbeams darted in and found it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Drops of dew stole in by night, and crown’d it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But no foot of man e’er trod that way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Earth was young and keeping holiday.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Monster fishes swam the silent main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Stately forests waved their giant branches,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Mountains hurled their snowy avalanches,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mammoth creatures stalked across the plain;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nature reveled in grand mysteries:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the little fern was not of these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Did not number with the hills and trees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Only grew and waved its wild sweet way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">None ever came to note it day by day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth one time put on a frolic mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the deep, strong currents of the ocean,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moved the plain and shook the haughty wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Crushed the little fern in soft moist clay,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Covered it, and hid it safe away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, the long, long centuries since that day!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, the agony! Oh, life’s bitter cost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Since that useless little fern was lost!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Useless? Lost? There came a thoughtful man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Searching Nature’s secrets, far and deep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From a fissure in a rocky steep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He withdrew a stone, o’er which there ran</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fairy pencilings, a quaint design,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Veinings, leafage, fibers clear and fine!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So, I think God hides some souls away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sweetly to surprise us, the last day.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Despise not labor! God did not despise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The handicraft which wrought this gorgeous globe,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And clad the earth in nature’s queenly robe.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He dug the first canal—the river’s bed,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wove the first carpet for man’s haughty tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The warp and woof of his first covering.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He made the pictures painters imitate,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There is no deed of honest labor born</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That is not Godlike; in the toiling limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howe’er the lazy scoff, the brainless scorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God labored first; toil likens us to Him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ashamed of work! mechanic, with thy tools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The tree thy ax cut from its native sod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turns to useful things—go tell to fools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was fashioned in the factory of God.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go build your ships, go build your lofty dome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Your granite temple, that through time endures,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your humble cot, or that proud pile of Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His arm has toiled there in advance of yours.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever thing is worthy to be had,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis not profession that ennobles men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Tis not the calling that can e’er degrade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trowel is as worthy as the pen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The pen more mighty than the hero’s blade.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The merchant, with his ledger and his wares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The lawyer with his cases and his books,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The toiling farmer, with his wheat and tares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The poet by the shaded streams and nooks,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The man, whate’er his work, wherever done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If intellect and honor guide his hand,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And rich as any Rothschild of the land.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All mere distinctions based upon pretense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are merely laughing themes for manly hearts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The miner’s cradle claims from men of sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">More honor than the youngling Bonaparte’s.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let fops and fools the sons of toil deride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On false pretensions brainless dunces live;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let carpet heroes strut with parlor pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Supreme in all that indolence can give,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But be not like them, and pray envy not</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These fancy tom-tit burlesques of mankind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The witless snobs in idleness who rot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hermaphrodite ’twixt vanity and mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O son of toil, be proud, look up, arise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And disregard opinion’s hollow test,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A false society’s decrees despise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He is most worthy who has labored best.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scepter is less royal than the hoe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The sword, beneath whose rule whole nations writhe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And curse the wearer, while they fear the blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is far less noble than the plow and scythe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s more true honor on one tan-browned hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rough with the honest work of busy men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than all the soft-skinned punies of the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The nice, white-kiddery of upper ten.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow bright the forge—the sturdy anvil ring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It sings the anthem of king Labor’s courts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sweeter sounds the clattering hammers bring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than half a thousand thumped piano-fortes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair are the ribbons from the rabbet-plane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As those which grace my lady’s hat or cape,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor does the joiner’s honor blush or wane</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Beside the lawyer, with his brief and tape.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pride thee, mechanic, on thine honest trade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Tis nobler than the snob’s much vaunted pelf.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man’s soulless pride his test of worth has made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But thine is based on that of God himself.</div>

<h5>LINCOLN, THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Edwin Markham</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the Norn-Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bent the strenuous Heavens and came down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make a man to meet the mortal need.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She took the tried clay of the common road—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was a stuff to wear for centuries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man that matched the mountains, and compelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stars to look our way and honor us.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tang and odor of the primal things—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rectitude and patience of the rocks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The courage of the bird that dares the sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pity of the snow that hides all scars;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The loving-kindness of the wayside well;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tolerance and equity of light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That gives as freely to the shrinking weed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As to the great oak flaring to the wind—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the grave’s low hill as to the Matterhorn</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">And so he came.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Forevermore he burned to do his deed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He built the rail-pile as he built the State,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The conscience of him testing every stroke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make his deed the measure of a man.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">So came the Captain with the mighty heart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the step of Earthquake shook the house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rafters of the Home. He held his place—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held the long purpose like a growing tree—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Above the strife and hate and fever pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The squalid talk and walk of sordid men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He saw the vision changeless as the stars</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That shone through temple gates or prison bars,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561"></a>[561]</span>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or to the body nailed upon the tree,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Coquetting all day with the sunbeams,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And stealing their golden edge;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In the lap of that dim old forest</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He lieth in peace asleep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Light as the down of the thistle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Free as the winds that blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We roved there the beautiful summers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The summers of long ago;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But his feet on the hills grew weary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, one of the autumn eves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I made for my little brother</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A bed of the yellow leaves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweetly his pale arms folded</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My neck in a meek embrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the light of immortal beauty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Silently covered his face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the arrows of sunset</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lodged in the tree-tops bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He fell, in his saint-like beauty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Asleep by the gates of light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore, of all the pictures</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That hang on memory’s wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The one of the dim old forest</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We have had enough of action, and of motion we,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,</div>

<h5>THE BELLS OF SAN GABRIEL</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Charles Warren Stoddard</span></p>

<p>[Particularly note the possibility of onomatopoesy in the following refrain.
What answer do the bells give to the questions of the poet? There is no other
answer than their steady, monotonous toll. The answer must be found in your
own heart, viz., that no good work, done with high zeal and enthusiasm, with self-sacrifice,
ever can be in vain. Then read the refrain as a bell would sound, if it
were struck at the end of each line, prolonging the sound to correspond with the
continued resonance of the bell.]</p>

<h5>THE LAND OF HEART’S REGRET</h5>

<p class="center">W. T. P.</p>

<p>[This exquisite threnody was written by the “gardener poet” of California,
Samuel J. Alexander, of San Mateo. The local geographical references will be
understood only by those familiar with the country, but the cry of the bereaved
heart and life will find immediate response from the universal heart. As a poem of
deep, tender emotion, its study and rendition orally will be more than well repaid.]</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And by all that was and by all that is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for all that we were, I ask thee this,</div>

<span class="smaller">IMPERSONATION</span></h3>

</div>

<p>By “impersonation” we mean the art of assuming for the
time being the rôle of some character in a story or a play.
We “play the part,” we assume the carriage, the gestures,
the quality of voice belonging to the character.</p>

<p>How do we acquire this art? <i>First</i>: We study the part carefully
till we are sure we understand it. <i>Second</i>: We visualize
the scenes, and live them over again in our own imagination.
<i>Third</i>: We begin to speak the lines. We try different inflections,
different gestures which suggest themselves to us through
our own experiences and our observation of characters in real
life which are similar to those of the character we are depicting.
This careful observation of the mannerisms and eccentricities
of real people aids very materially in interpretation.
<i>Finally</i>: We decide on the gestures and inflections which seem
to us to most nearly interpret the part, and these we practice
over and over again until they become a part of our very being,
<i>then we are ready to “play the part.”</i></p>

<h5><i>Merchant of Venice</i></h5>

<p><i>Enter old Gobbo, with a basket.</i></p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
master Jew’s?</p>

<p><i>Launcelot</i> (<i>Aside</i>).—O heavens, this my true-begotten father! who,
being more than sand-blind, high-gravel-blind, knows me not: I will
try confusions with him.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
master Jew’s?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_655"></a>[655]</span></p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning,
turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—By God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell
me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Talk you of young Master Launcelot? (<i>Aside.</i>) Mark
me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master
Launcelot?</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—No Master, sir, but a poor man’s son: his father, though I
say’t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thank’d, well to
live.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Well, let his father be what a will, we talk of young
Master Launcelot.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Your worship’s friend, and Launcelot, sir.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—But, I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
you of young Master Launcelot?</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Of Launcelot, an’t please your mastership.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
father; for the young gentleman—according to Fates, and Destinies,
and such odd saying, the Sisters Three, and such branches of learning—is,
indeed, deceas’d; or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to
heaven.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my age,
my very prop.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot</i> (<i>Aside</i>).—Do I look like a cudgel or a hovelpost, a staff
or a prop?—Do you know me, father?</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman: but, I
pray you, tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul!—alive or dead?</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Do you not know me, father?</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old
man, I will tell you news of your son: give me your blessing. Truth
will come to light; murder cannot be hid long,—a man’s son may; but,
in the end, truth will out.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not Launcelot,
my boy.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give
me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is,
your child that shall be.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—I cannot think you are my son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_656"></a>[656]</span></p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—I know not what I shall think of that: but I am Launcelot,
the Jew’s man; and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Her name is Margery, indeed: I’ll be sworn, if thou be
Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord, worship’d might
he be! What a beard hast thou got! thou hast got more hair on thy
chin than Dobbin, my fill-horse, has on his tail.</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward:
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have on my face, when
I last saw him.</p>

<p><i>Gobbo.</i>—Lord, how art thou chang’d! How dost thou and thy master
agree? I have brought him a present. How ’gree you now?</p>

<p><i>Launcelot.</i>—Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My
master’s a very Jew: give him a present! give him a halter: I am
famish’d in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs.
Father, I am glad you are come: give me your present to one Master
Bassanio, who, indeed, gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
will run as far as God has any ground.—O rare fortune! here comes
the man:—to him, father, for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But not intentively: I did consent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And often did beguile her of her tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I did speak of some distressful stroke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I should but teach him how to tell my story,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</div>

<h5>THE SEVEN AGES</h5>

<p>[This is a succession of purely imaginative ideas which the voice should touch
lightly. In this speech one meets always the question of impersonation: shall the
mewling infant, the whining schoolboy, the sighing lover and the rest be imitated
by the reader? It is in better taste not to impersonate these seven characters
beyond certain almost imperceptible hints which the gayety of Jaques’s mind might
naturally throw off.]</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">They have their exits and their entrances;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one man in his time plays many parts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shining morning face, creeping like snail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeking the bubble reputation</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In fair round belly with good capon lined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full of wise saws and modern instances;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ends this strange eventful history,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</div>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Why, cousin; why Rosalind;—Cupid have mercy;—Not a

<p><i>Ros.</i> Not one to throw to a dog.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs,
throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one should be
lamed with reasons, and the other mad without any.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> But is all this for your father?</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> No, some of it for my father’s child: O, how full of briars
is this working-day world!</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> They are but burrs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery;
if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very coats will catch
them.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> I could shake them off my coat; these burrs are in my heart.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Hem them away.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> I would try; if I could cry hem, and have him.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong
a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> The duke my father lov’d his father dearly.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Doth it therefore ensue, that you should love his son dearly?
By this kind of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his
father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> No ’faith, hate him not, for my sake.</p>

<p><i>Duke F.</i> Mistress, despatch you with your safest haste, and get you

<p><i>Duke F.</i> You, cousin, within these ten days if thou be’st found so
near our public court as twenty miles, thou diest for it.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> I do beseech your grace, let me the knowledge of my fault
bear with me: if with myself I hold intelligence, or have acquaintance
with mine own desires; if that I do not dream, or be not frantic (as I
do trust I am not), then, dear uncle, never so much as in a thought
unborn, did I offend your highness.</p>

<p><i>Duke F.</i> Thus do all traitors, if their purgation did consist in words,
they are as innocent as grace itself: let it suffice thee, that I trust
thee not.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor: tell me, whereon
the likelihood depends.</p>

<p><i>Duke F.</i> Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> So was I, when your highness took his dukedom; so was I,
when your highness banish’d him: treason is not inherited, my lord: or,
if we did derive it from our friends, what’s that to me? my father
was no traitor: then, good my liege, mistake me not so much, to think
my poverty is treacherous.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</p>

<p><i>Duke F.</i> Aye, Celia; we stay’d here for your sake. Else had she
with her father rang’d along.</p>

<p><i>Cel.</i> I did not then entreat to have her stay, it was your pleasure,
and your own remorse; I was too young that time to value her, but
now I know her; if she be a traitor, so am I: we still have slept
together; rose at an instant, learn’d, play’d, eat together;</p>

<h3>HAMLET’S INSTRUCTION TO THE PLAYERS</h3>

<p>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,—trippingly
on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had
as lief the town-crier spake my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest,
and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire
and beget a temperance, that may give it smoothness. Oh! it offends
me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to tatters,—to very rags,—to split the ears of the groundlings; who, for
the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb show and
noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant;
it out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.</p>

<span class="smaller">ORATORIC READING AND THE ART OF PUBLIC SPEECH</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Upon this important subject of public speaking, and the interpretation
of the addresses made by others, great men have
thus expressed themselves: Dr. Charles W. Eliot, formerly
President of Harvard University, says: “Have we not all seen,
in recent years, that leading men of business have a great need
of a highly trained power of clear and convincing expression?
Business men seem to me to need, in speech and writing, all
the Roman terseness and the French clearness. That one attainment
is sufficient reward for the whole long course of
twelve years spent in liberal study.” Abraham Lincoln likewise
said: “Extemporaneous speaking should be practiced and
cultivated. It is the lawyer’s avenue to the public. However
able and faithful he may be in other respects, people are slow
to bring him business if he can not make a speech.”</p>

<p>Every thinker knows what a vital part eloquence plays in
national as well as individual welfare. If at first thought
effective speaking seems a simple thing and a superficial part
of education, on mature thought and consideration it will be
found to be one of the most complex, vital and difficult problems
that education has to meet. And yet, notwithstanding
this complexity of the problem, the teacher is cheered by the
delightful assurance of giving the student a consciousness of
his latent talents and the ability to reveal and make use of
them for the proper influencing of his fellow men.</p>

<p>There is a belief fairly commonly held that only a limited
few need study the art of public speaking. Never was there
a greater error or a more fatal mistake—especially in a republic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_672"></a>[672]</span>
like ours, where every man should be vitally interested in
public affairs. No single citizen can afford not to be able to
stand before his fellows and clearly, pleasingly and convincingly
present his ideas upon any subject of local, state, or
national importance. It is no more an <i>ornamental</i> accomplishment
than is grammar, penmanship or simple arithmetic. It
should be as universal as “the three r’s.” The hints and selections
that follow are carefully chosen to incite every good citizen
to the acquirement of this useful and practical aid for his
own benefit as well as that of his fellows. All the lessons and
analyses that have gone before in these pages will materially
aid in the elucidation of these brief lessons.</p>

<p>The basis for development in Effective Speaking rests upon
one’s bodily, emotional and mental agencies of expression, and
a knowledge of their respective importance and efficient use.
That which counts most for development is conscientious practice;
without which, progress is impossible.</p>

<p>There are three definite means of communicating thought
and feeling to others: (a) Pantomime: face, hands, body; (b)
Vocal: tone sound; (c) Verbal: words, which are conventional
symbols manifesting mental and emotional states.</p>

<p>The problem, then, is to obtain a harmonious coördination of
these three languages. In other words, the content of the word
when spoken should be reflected in the tone and in the body.
Thus speech becomes effective merely because it receives its
just and fair consideration.</p>

<p>With this general understanding let us take up and master
the successive steps which ultimately lead to a realization of
the desired end.</p>

<p>The first important essential of effective speaking is the
<i>Spirit of Directness</i>. By this is meant natural, unaffected
speech. Nothing can be more important than that the person
speaking use in public address the ordinary elements of <i>Conversation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_673"></a>[673]</span></p>

<p>Hence, the first step is <i>practice</i> in <i>natural</i> speaking. Commit
to memory <i>Hamlet’s Instructions to the Players</i> given on
a preceding page. Do this not line by line, but the entire selection
as a whole. <i>First</i>: Read it through silently three times
to familiarize yourself with the subject-matter. <i>Second</i>:
Read it aloud at least five times. <i>Third</i>: Speak it <i>conversationally</i>
at least five times from memory. In this practice
always be intensely conscious that you are addressing an individual
and not an audience.</p>

<p>Now take any of the prose or poetic selections from the
earlier pages of this book, memorize them, after studying
them as the instructions require, and speak them <i>directly</i> and
<i>naturally</i>, in the ordinary <i>conversational</i> style.</p>

<p>Sufficient practice in this is the necessary preparation for the
next step, viz., the acquiring of a natural <i>elevated</i> conversational
style, which is merely another name for the higher type
of public speaking.</p>

<p>Commit all, or a part, of the following selections, keeping in
mind that in speaking them you are addressing a group of
people.</p>

<h4>THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Abraham Lincoln</span></p>

<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great
Civil War, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and
so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of
that war. We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting
place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.</p>

<p>It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a
larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow
this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world
will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never
forget what they did here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_674"></a>[674]</span></p>

<p>It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be
here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they
gave their last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve
that these dead shall not have died in vain, that the Union shall, under
God, have a new birth of freedom, and that the government of the people,
by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>By this time you should have mastered Ordinary Conversational
Style; Elevated Conversational Style; and Abandon and
Flexibility of Speech. The next consideration is the importance
of Clearness. Clearness in speech means making prominent
central words and subordinating unimportant words, or
phrases. In other words, the logical sequence of thought must
be clearly shown. This is brought about by a variety of inflections,
changes of pitch, pause, etc. Clearness in speech is
dependent upon clearness of <i>Thinking</i>.</p>

<p>It is important now to give full consideration to the subject
of <i>Emphasis</i>. There are more ways than one of emphasizing
your thought. The most common way is by merely increasing
the stress of voice upon a word. This, however, is the
most undignified form of emphasis. It is common to ranters
and “soap-box” orators and is one mark of an undisciplined
and uncultured man. Remember that loudness is a purely
physical element, and does not manifest thought. Such emphasis
is an appeal to the brute instinct, and is only expressive
of the lower emotions. But Inflection, Changes of Pitch,
Pause, Movement and Tone-Color—as have been fully explained
in preceding pages—all appeal to the exalted nature
of man.</p>

<p>In proportion to the nobleness of an emotion or thought,
we find a tendency to accentuate these above-named elements.
Such methods of emphasis are appropriate to the most disciplined
and cultured man. More than that, they are the surest
evidence of a great personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_675"></a>[675]</span></p>

<p>Commit, then make clear to the hearer, the vital thought in
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He have arbitrary power! My lords, the East India Company have
not arbitrary power to give him; the King has no arbitrary power to
give him; your Lordships have not; nor the Commons; nor the whole
legislature. We have no arbitrary power to give, because arbitrary
power is a thing which neither any man can hold nor any man can give.
No man can lawfully govern himself according to his own will, much
less can one person be governed by the will of another. We are all
born in subjection, all born equally, high and low, governors and governed,
in subjection to one great, immutable, preëxistent law, prior to
all our devices, and prior to all our contrivances, paramount to all our
ideas and all our sensations, antecedent to our very existence, by which
we are knit and connected in the eternal frame of the universe, out of
which we cannot stir.</p>

</div>

<p>Extract from President Wilson’s Inaugural Address:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be
modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write
upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit
of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge,
not shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions
whither they cannot tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be our
motto.</p>

<p>And yet it will be no cool process of mere science. The nation has
been deeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge
of wrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and
made an instrument of evil.</p>

<p>The feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity
sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of God’s own presence,
where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the
brother are one.</p>

<p>We know our task to be no mere task of politics, but a task which
shall search us through and through, whether we be able to understand
our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed their spokesmen
and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to comprehend
and the rectified will to choose our high course of action. This is not
a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster, not the
forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men’s hearts wait upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_676"></a>[676]</span>
us; men’s lives hang in the balance; men’s hopes call upon us to say
what we will do.</p>

<p>Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares fail to try?</p>

<p>I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men, to
my side.</p>

<p>God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and
sustain me!</p>

</div>

<h4>SELECTIONS FOR PART FOUR</h4>

<p>To gain control over public speech, to learn to express himself well
on his feet, the speaker must both be constantly watchful over his
every-day conversation and exercise himself much in writing. Only so
can he make his tongue obey his will.-<span class="smcap">Genung.</span></p>

<p>If then the power of speech is a gift as great as any that can be
named,—if the origin of language is by many philosophers even considered
to be nothing short of divine,—if by means of words the secrets
of the heart are brought to light, pain of soul is relieved, hidden
grief is carried off, sympathy conveyed, counsel imparted, experience
recorded, and wisdom perpetuated,—if by great authors the many are
drawn up into unity, national character is fixed, a people speaks, the
past and the future, the East and the West are brought into communication
with each other,—if such men are, in a word, the spokesmen
and prophets of the human family,—it will not answer to make light of
Literature or to neglect its study; rather we may be sure that, in proportion
as we master it in whatever language, and imbibe its spirit, we
shall ourselves become in our own measure the ministers of like benefits
to others, be they many or few, be they in the obscurer or the
more distinguished walks of life,—who are united to us by social ties,
and are within the sphere of our personal influence.</p>

<h5>A VISION RISES</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Robert G. Ingersoll</span></p>

<p>A vision of the future rises.... I see a world where thrones have
crumbled and where kings are dust, the aristocracy of idleness has perished
from the earth.</p>

<p>I see a world without a slave, man at last is free. Nature’s forces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_677"></a>[677]</span>
have by science been enslaved, lightning and light, wind and wave,
frost and flame, and all the secret subtle powers of the earth and air
are the tireless toilers for the human race.</p>

<p>I see a world at peace, adorned with every form of art, with music’s
myriad voices thrilled, while lips are rich with words of love and truth;
a world in which no exile sighs, no prisoner mourns; a world on
which the gibbet’s shadow does not fall; a world where labor reaps its
full reward, where work and worth go hand in hand, where the poor
girl, trying to win bread with a needle—the needle that has been called
“the asp for the breast of the poor”—is not driven to the desperate
choice of crime or death or suicide or shame.</p>

<p>I see a world without the beggar’s outstretched palm, the miser’s
heartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the livid lips of lies, the
cruel eyes of scorn.</p>

<p>I see a race without disease of flesh or brain—shapely and fair, married
harmony of form and function, and as I look, life lengthens, joy
deepens, love canopies the earth; and over all in the great dome shines
the eternal star of human hope.</p>

<h5>CREED OF AMERICANISM</h5>

<p>I have faith that this government of ours was divinely ordained to
disclose whether men are by nature fitted or can by education be made
fit for self-government; to teach Jew and Greek, bondman and free,
alike, the essential equality of all men before the law and to be tender
and true to humanity everywhere and under all circumstances; to
reveal that service is the highest reward of life....</p>

<p>I believe that the world, now advancing and now retreating, is nevertheless
moving forward to a far-off divine event wherein the tongues
of Babel will again be blended in the language of a common brotherhood;
and I believe that I can reach the highest ideal of my tradition
and my lineage as an American—as a man, as a citizen and as a public
official—when I judge my fellowmen without malice and with charity,
when I worry more about my own motives and conduct and less about
the motives and conduct of others. The time I am liable to be wholly
wrong is when I know that I am absolutely right....</p>

<p>I believe there is no finer form of government than the one under
which we live and that I ought to be willing to live or to die, as God
decrees, that it may not perish from off the earth through treachery
within or through assault without; and I believe that though my first
right is to be a partisan, that my first duty, when the only principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_678"></a>[678]</span>
on which free government can rest are being strained, is to be a patriot
and to follow in a wilderness of words that clear call which bids me
guard and defend the ark of our national covenant.—From “Vice-President
Marshall’s Inaugural Address.”</p>

<h5>WHAT IS OUR COUNTRY</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Governor Newton Booth</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Extract from speech delivered at Sacramento, Calif., August 14, 1862.</i>)</p>

<p>What is our country? Not alone the land and the sea, the lakes and
rivers, and valleys and mountains; not alone the people, their customs
and laws; not alone the memories of the past, the hopes of the future:
it is something more than all these combined. It is a divine abstraction.
You cannot tell what it is; but let its flag rustle above your
head, you feel its living presence in your hearts. They tell us that our
country must die; that the sun and the stars will look down upon the
great republic no more; that already the black eagles of despotism are
gathering in our political sky; that, even now, kings and emperors are
casting lots for the garments of our national glory. It shall not be!
Not yet, not yet, shall the nations lay the bleeding corpse of our country
in the tomb. If they could, angels would roll the stone from the
mouth of the sepulcher. It would burst the casements of the grave and
come forth a living presence, “redeemed, regenerated, disenthralled.”
Not yet, not yet shall the republic die! The heavens are not darkened,
the stones are not rent! It shall live, the incarnation of freedom; it
shall live, the embodiment of the power and majesty of the people.
Baptized anew, it shall stand a thousand years to come, the Colossus
of the nations,—its feet upon the continents, its scepter over the seas,
its forehead among the stars!—From “Notable Speeches by Notable
Speakers of the Greater West,” by kind permission of the publishers;

<h5>PIONEER CELEBRATION SPEECH</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Frederick Palmer Tracey</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Delivered before the society of California Pioneers, September 9, 1858,
at their celebration of the eighth anniversary of the admission of the
state into the Union.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. President, and Members of the Society of California Pioneers:
The great Napoleon said, “I will review at Cherbourg the marvels of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_679"></a>[679]</span>
Egypt,” and that saying, just now inscribed upon the pedestal of his
statue standing amidst the new and massive fortifications of Cherbourg,
startles England as a menace of war. England may rest in
quiet. There will be no attempt to renew the marvels of Bonaparte’s
Egyptian campaign. But both Napoleons may have dreamed that in
the gigantic moles of Cherbourg they might rival the grandeur and
strength of the Pyramids, and in its sculptures the glorious beauty of
Memnon and the Sphinx. And, truly, the vast dead marvels of Egypt’s
architecture may be rivaled. Other tombs and temples may be hewn
in the rocks; other columns and obelisks may rise in beauty; other
sphinxes may in silence propose their eternal riddles to other lands; and
other pyramids may lift their mountain forms over the hushed plains
crouching at their feet. Greater marvels even than Egypt ever saw
may be born of necessity and science, and not Cherbourg alone, but this
and other lands may yet behold them.</p>

<p>But who, in any age or country, or with any people, shall renew the
marvels of California, and give to the world a second example of a
nation so suddenly created, gifted with the strength of Hercules in its
cradle,—born in the purple of its empire that shall endure forever? A
little more than ten years ago, California lay in the indolence and
silence of that summer noonday in which she had been basking for
ages. A few idle villages slept by the shores of her bays; a few
squalid ranches dotted the interior with patches of wretched cultivation.
There were herds of cattle in her valleys, but they were almost valueless
for the want of a market. There were churches, but their chiming
bells woke only the echoes of a vast solitude. The sun ripened only
the harvest of wild oats on the hills, and the beasts of prey made their
lairs in security close by the abodes of men. Seldom did the <i>vaquero</i>
in his solitary rounds hear the dip of the oar upon our rivers. Silence,
deep and everlasting, brooded over all the land, and the lone oaks on
the hills appeared like sentinels keeping guard around the sleeping camp
of nature.</p>

<p>The cession of the country to the United States by the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the discovery of gold in the early part of the
year of 1848, changed the whole scene as if by the power of magic.
As in the naumachia of old time, the dry arena was instantly converted
into a great lake on which contending navies struggled for the mastery;
so, instantly on the discovery of gold, California was filled with people
as if they had risen from the earth. The port of San Francisco was
crowded with vessels. The rivers were alive with the multitudes that
made them their highway, and din of commerce broke forever the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_680"></a>[680]</span>
silence of centuries. It seemed as if the people had stolen the lamp of
Aladdin, and wished for the creation, not of palaces merely, but of
royal cities, and an empire of which these should be the chief places;
and at their wish, the cities of our state arose, not by slow, toilsome
growth, but complete and princely at their very birth. The rattle of the
shovel and the pick was heard in every mountain gorge, and a wide
stream of gold flowed from the Sierra to the sea. The plains, rejoicing
in their marriage to industry, bore fruitfully their yellow harvests.
Villages, hamlets, farmhouses, schools, and churches sprang up everywhere;
wharves were built, roads were opened; stage-coaches and
steamers crowded all profitable routes; lands, houses, and labor rose to
an enormous value; and plenty, with her blessings, crowned the rolling
year.</p>

<p>I paint no exaggerated picture of this magical change. We have
seen it with our eyes; and though it seems like a dream, so is it unlike
anything in the history of the world, in the range of human experience,
or in the field where imagination is wont to revel. We know that it
is all true, and its truth is its greatest marvel.</p>

<p>Yet it is not to be concealed that we have reason to fear that California’s
future may not be as prosperous as her past. If free institutions
shall be established here in the simplicity of truth and justice;
if public morality shall be substituted for the wild, passionate life of
our earlier times; if industry and frugality shall expel indolence and
thriftlessness from among us; if the people shall be made to feel that
California is their home, and be controlled by the great ambition of
making it a home worth loving and defending; if we shall be united
for the promotion and protection of our own state interests, and shall
banish from among us all influence of those who do not belong to us,—then
indeed we cannot fail to secure a glorious future for our young
state. But if we fail in the great duties of upright men and patriotic
citizens, we can only expect to—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And die, like them, of unbelief in God and wrong of man.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That California has the material resources to make her not merely
one of the first, but the very first, of the states of the Union, no one
can doubt; but the fostering care of the general government, and the
exertion of all the energies of our own people will be required to develop
those resources and make our state what it is capable of becoming.
I have dreamed of the time when that great highway of commerce
around the Cape of Good Hope, opened to the world by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_681"></a>[681]</span>
Portuguese navigators of the fifteenth century, should be abandoned,
and long caravans of merchant ships, treading the desert ocean that
lies at our west, should bring to our wharves the merchandise of China
and the Indies, and give to us the profits of that vast trade which has
built so many of the cities of Europe and of Asia; when along the
great Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, from San Francisco to St. Louis,
and from St. Louis to the Atlantic seaboard, the transit of this wealth
of the world, like a turbid stream turned through our miners’ sluice-boxes,
should everywhere deposit gold as it passed. If California and
the general government shall ever be aroused upon this subject, and
this great railway—the mightiest in its results of any enterprise ever
projected by man—shall be completed, a revolution will be accomplished
in our state, the marvels of which will be second only to those that
accompanied our first settlement of the territory. Our population, no
longer stinted to a few hundred thousand, will suddenly be counted by
millions. Every valley will be fat with grain, and the yellow harvest
will wave on every hillside. The hamlets will rise to villages, the villages
to towns, and the towns to regal cities. Like the redwoods of our
mountains, the masts of the vessels of all nations will be forests in our
ports, and the white sails in the offing shall flock together as white
doves when they come home to their nests. Then, capital will seek
investment among us, and enterprise and industry will add wealth to
wealth. Then will the hidden riches of the mines be explored, and
larger and more secure investments afford a profit that now is hardly
dreamed of. Every resource of the state will be developed, and California
will become the mistress of the Pacific, rivaling not merely the
richest commercial states of our own confederacy, but the most powerful
maritime nations that sit by the shores of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Such California once was; such California yet may be. You, pioneers,
who meet to-day to celebrate the eighth anniversary of her admission
as a state of the Union,—you, and those whom you represent, are
the founders of this new commonwealth, and on the direction you give
her institutions and her enterprise her destiny for good or evil will
depend.</p>

<p>I congratulate you, Pioneers of California, on the proud position you
occupy.</p>

you discharge that trust with honor to yourselves, and so that California

<h5>THE REDWOODS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. H. L. Barnes</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Delivered at a midsummer “jinks” of the Bohemian Club of San
Francisco.</i>)</p>

<p>The possessor of a name more ancient than the crusaders will show
you, in the land of his birth, ancestral trees that surround his lordly
domain, and proudly exhibit some gnarled and ugly oak, which by him
is associated with some distant event in his own family, or with the
history of the hoary races of the brave nation of which he forms a
part. Here his ancestors builded a castle before the Middle Ages, with
defensive moat and parapet, with keep and dungeon, all long since
fallen into ruin,—melted in the unperceived decay of ages, or bruised
into it by the vigor of the battering-ram of some gallant and feudal
company.</p>

<p>He will say to you, “All these are mine. They are part of my race,
and my race is of them.” But what are all his possessions—castle,
moat, dungeon, or gnarled oak—beside the ancient brotherhood of venerable
trees to which we have been admitted, and whose stately silence
we have been permitted to break? Our trees were old before the
Roman invaded Britain; old before the Saxon followed Hengist
and Horsa; old before the Vikings sailed the northern seas. For ages
piled upon ages, even before letters were known, before history commenced
to make its record of the doings of nations and races, these
trees and their ancestors builded and renewed their leafy castles.</p>

<p>The groupings of the present monarchs of the forest show that these
are but the descendants of still more ancient growths; were once nothing
but saplings that sprung from the superabundant life of some giant
trunk long since vanished, and whose grave is sentineled by his stalwart
children. How shall we measure the vigor and force which they
possess? How shall we comprehend by what method the stately body,
ever rising in monumental force toward the skies, draws its being from
the deep and busy fingers of the roots, and from them lifts the alchemized
earth and water higher and still higher, until both feed and nourish
the smallest leaf and spear-point of the topmost shaft,—spear-point
that, in its turn, is destined in some future age to become a stalwart
trunk, crowding with its growth ever upward and onward towards the
stars?</p>

<p>Who shall tell how, through the eons of the long ago, these trees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684"></a>[684]</span>
have been silent and majestic watchers of the night and dawn and day
of the world’s life? How shall we conjecture how long they have
been welcoming the sun in his rising, and have caught his last and
lingering caress as he has disappeared in the glory of the evening sky?
How long have they been the vigil keepers of the night, and watched
the silent constellations sailing through the immensity of space? Who
shall tell us if these trees caught, perhaps, the earliest song of the stars
of the morning, while above and beyond them, unnumbered comet and
meteor have shone and vanished?</p>

<p>How came these trees to this continent? Have they ever lived and
burgeoned in some other happy land? or are they the fruit of one sole
and giant extravagance of nature, exulting in the uppermost luxury of
force, and reveling in the very fullness of all power? Shall man solve
the mystery? Nature is full of lessons yet to be learned, but nowhere
in air or earth or water is there more awe-inspiring strangeness than
in these great growths whose wonder we have studied, but with study
fruitless of revelation.</p>

<p>To me, during the days we spent in the forest, the contemplation of
the redwoods was never for a moment wearisome. I have looked up
along their marvelous length in the early morning, when the frondent
and topmost spear caught the first glimpse of the sun’s glory, and I
have seen his afternoon rays flashing and glinting on emerald bough
and purple trunk, and at last losing themselves in the depths of a solemn
and impenetrable shade. I have lain at night on the dry earth and
looked up at the closing vista of the dark boughs fretting the moonlight
and shutting out the sparkle of the stars, until their weird shapes
seemed summited in their very pathway; and I saw, when Pan killed
Care upon the mountain-side that overhung the grove, such an illumination
of the glory of the trees in purple and crimson and scarlet
as shall forever make the ablest effort of the scenic artist stale, tawdry,
unendurable.</p>

<h5>THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Abraham Lincoln</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Delivered from the steps of the Capitol at Washington, 1865.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow Countrymen</span>: At this second appearing to take the oath of
the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address
than there was at first. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685"></a>[685]</span>
course to be pursued seemed very fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration
of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly
called forth on every point and phase of the great contest
which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation,
little that is new could be presented.</p>

<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as
well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably
satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no
prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>

<p>On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts
were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all
sought to avoid it. While the inaugural address was being delivered
from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it with war—seeking
to dissolve the Union and divide the effects by negotiation. Both
parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than
let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let
it perish, and the war came. One-eighth of the whole population were
colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized
in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and
powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause
of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was
the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union by war,
while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the
territorial enlargement of it.</p>

<p>Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration
which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the
conflict might cease when, or even before, the conflict itself should
cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental
and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the
same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in
wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces; but let us
judge not, that we be not judged. The prayer of both could not be
answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty
has His own purposes. Woe unto the world because of offenses, for
it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the
offense cometh. If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of
those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but
which having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to
remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_686"></a>[686]</span>
as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern
there any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in
a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do
we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.
Yet if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be
sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be repaid
by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years
ago, so still it must be said, that the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.</p>

<p>With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
right as God gives us to see the right, let us finish the work we are in,
to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne
the battle, and for his widow and his orphans, to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.</p>

<h5>TOUSSAINT L’OUVERTURE</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Wendell Phillips</span></p>

<p>If I were to tell you the story of Napoleon, I should take it from the
lips of Frenchmen, who find no language rich enough to paint the great
captain of the nineteenth century. Were I to tell you the story of
Washington, I should take it from your hearts,—you who think no
marble white enough on which to carve the name of the father of his
country. But I am to tell you the story of a negro, Toussaint
L’Ouverture, who has left hardly one written line. I am to glean it
from the reluctant testimony of his enemies,—men who despised him
because he was a negro and a slave, hated him because he had beaten
them in battle.</p>

<p>Cromwell manufactured his own army. Napoleon, at the age of
twenty-seven, was placed at the head of the best troops Europe ever
saw. Cromwell never saw an army till he was forty; this man never
saw a soldier till he was fifty. Cromwell manufactured his own army—out
of what? England,—the best blood in Europe. Out of the middle
class of Englishmen,—the best blood of the island. And with it he
conquered what? Englishmen,—their equals. This man manufactured
his army out of what? Out of what you call the despicable race of
negroes, debased, demoralized by two hundred years of slavery, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_687"></a>[687]</span>
hundred thousand of them imported into the island within four years,
unable to speak a dialect intelligible even to each other. Yet out of
this mixed and, as you say, despicable mass, he forged a thunderbolt,
and hurled it at what? At the proudest blood in Europe, the Spaniard,
and sent him home conquered; at the most warlike blood in Europe,
the French, and put them under his feet; at the pluckiest blood in
Europe, the English, and they skulked home to Jamaica. Now, if
Cromwell was a general, this man was a soldier.</p>

<p>Now, blue-eyed Saxon, proud of your age, go back with me to the
commencement of the century, and select what statesman you please.
Let him be either American or European; let him have the ripest
training of university routine; let him add to it the better education
of practical life; crown his temples with the silver locks of seventy
years, and show me the man of Saxon lineage for whom his most sanguine
admirer will wreathe a laurel, rich as embittered foes have placed
on the brow of this negro,—rare military skill, profound knowledge of
human nature, content to blot out all party distinctions, and trust a
state to the blood of his sons,—anticipating Sir Robert Peel fifty years,
and taking his station by the side of Roger Williams, before any Englishman
or American had won the right; and yet this is the record
which the history of rival States makes up for this inspired black of
St. Domingo.</p>

<p>Some doubt the courage of the negro. Go to Hayti, and stand on
those fifty thousand graves of the best soldiers France ever had, and
ask them what they think of the negro’s courage.</p>

<p>I would call him Napoleon, but Napoleon made his way to empire
over broken oaths and through a sea of blood. This man never broke
his word. I would call him Cromwell, but Cromwell was only a soldier,
and the state he founded went down with him into his grave.
I would call him Washington, but the great Virginian held slaves.
This man risked his empire rather than permit the slave-trade in the
humblest village of his dominions.</p>

<p>You think me a fanatic, for you read history, not with your eyes, but
with your prejudices. But fifty years hence, when Truth gets a hearing,
the Muse of history will put Phocion for the Greek, Brutus for
the Roman, Hampden for England, Lafayette for France, choose
Washington as the bright consummate flower of our earlier civilization,
then, dipping her pen in the sunlight, will write in the clear blue,
above them all, the name of the soldier, the statesman, the martyr,
Toussaint L’Ouverture.</p>

<h5>THE TWO GEORGES</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. H. Rhodes</span></p>

<p>Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born
on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to
exert a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well
as to control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.</p>

<p>One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.</p>

<p>Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis
of England. It is the evening of the 4th of June, 1734. Some joyful
event must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire. Nor is the circumstance of
a private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city
is illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their
iron throats. The population seems frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other’s arms, in token of a national jubilee. Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated
on a commanding eminence, near the River Thames, whilst from the
loftiest towers of St. James’s Palace the national ensigns of St. George
and the Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze. Within one of the
most gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son. The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended. The corridors are thronged with
dukes, and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers. A Royal Proclamation
soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding British subjects
everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to rejoice,
and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence George William
Frederic, heir presumptive of the United crowns of Great Britain
and Ireland.</p>

<p>Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended the throne of
his ancestors as King George the Third.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate
a scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character. It is the 22nd of February, 1732. The locality is a
distant colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in
with clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards. Snow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_689"></a>[689]</span>
covers the ground, and a chill wintry wind is drifting the flakes, and
moaning through the forest. Two immense chimneys stand at either
end of the house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive
hospitality within, totally in contrast with external nature. There are
but four small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the
wife of Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son. No
dukes or marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.
There are no princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia
of royalty, and fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a
kingdom. His first breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol,
the air laden with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft
music and the “murmurs of low fountains.” But the child is received
from its mother’s womb by hands embrowned with honest labor, and
laid upon a lowly couch, indicative only of a back-woodsman’s home
and an American’s inheritance. He, too, is christened George, and
forty-three years afterward took command of the American forces
assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.</p>

<p>But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.</p>

<p>From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only the language of
flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as caprice dictated,
slept upon the cygnet’s down, and grew up in indolence, self-will and
vanity, a dictator from his cradle. The peasant boy, on the other
hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was honorable, and hardships
indispensable to vigorous health. He early learned to sleep
alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a stone for his pillow,
and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of untamed nature
around him sang his morning and his evening hymns. Truth, courage
and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother’s counsels,
and the important lesson of life was taught by a father’s example,
that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.</p>

<p>Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king
over extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest
district surveyor.</p>

<p>Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their careers, let
us now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of each.</p>

<p>For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim
to all the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains,
stretching in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana. The
English strenuously denied this right, and when the French commandant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_690"></a>[690]</span>
on the Ohio, in 1753, commenced erecting a fort near where the
present city of Pittsburgh stands, and proceeded to capture certain
English traders, and expel them from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor
of Virginia, deemed it necessary to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic
visit to the French commandant and demand by what authority
he acted, by what title he claimed the country, and order him immediately
to evacuate the territory.</p>

<p>George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected
by the governor for this important mission.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintry
march through the wilderness. The historian of his life has painted
in imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness
in the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.
Memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintry snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts, for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.
How often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian
guide, on his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero! And oh! with what fervent
prayers do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent
of the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.
Standing bareheaded on the frail craft, whilst in the act of dashing
aside some floating ice that threatened to engulf him, the treacherous
oar was broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the
boiling current. Save! oh, save him, heaven! for the destinies of millions
yet unborn hang upon that noble arm!</p>

<p>Let us now recross the ocean. In the early part of the year 1764, a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.
The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and
greatly irritated. A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation
that the monarch is sick. His attendants look gloomy, his friends
terrified, and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.
Yet he has no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain
and agitated step along the corridors of the palace. His conduct
becomes gradually more and more strange, until doubt gives place to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_691"></a>[691]</span>
certainty, and the royal medical staff report to a select committee of
the House of Commons that the King is threatened with insanity.
For six weeks the cloud obscures his mental faculties, depriving him
of all interference with the administration of the government, and
betokening a sad disaster in the future. His reason is finally restored,
but frequent fits of passion, pride and obstinacy indicate but
too surely that the disease is deep-seated, and a radical cure impossible.</p>

<p>Not long after his return from the West, Washington was offered
the chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to
expel the French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment,
on account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post
of lieutenant-colonel. Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry,
he was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations
of his own. Subsequently, when the war between France and England
broke out in Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred
to America, and his majesty, George III, sent over a large body of
troops, under the command of favorite officers. But this was not
enough. An edict soon followed, denominated an “Order to settle the
rank of the officers of His Majesty’s forces serving in America.” By
one of the articles of this order, it was provided “that all officers
commissioned by the King should take precedence of those of the
same grade commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies,
although their commissions might be of junior date;” and it was further
provided, that “when the troops served together, the provincial
officers should enjoy no rank at all.” This order was scarcely promulgated—indeed,
before the ink was dry—ere the Governor of Virginia
received a communication informing him that George Washington was
no longer a soldier. Entreaties, exhortations and threats were all lavished
upon him in vain; and to those who, in their expostulations,
spoke of the defenseless frontiers of his native state, he patriotically
but nobly replied: “I will serve my country when I can do so without
dishonor.”</p>

<p>In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the
Stamp Act. This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the
most violent opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose
of effectual resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts
to Georgia. The leading English patriots, among whom were Burke
and Barré, protested against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_692"></a>[692]</span>
and the city of London presented a petition to the king, praying
him to dismiss the Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act.
“It is with the utmost astonishment,” replied the king, “that I find any
of my subjects capable of encouraging the rebellious disposition that
unhappily exists in some of my North American colonies. Having
entire confidence in the wisdom of my parliament, the great council of
the realm, I will steadily pursue those measures which they have recommended
for the support of the constitutional rights of Great Britain.”
He heeded not the memorable words of Burke, that afterward
became prophetic. “There are moments,” exclaimed this great statesman,
“critical moments in the fortunes of all states, when they who
are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may yet be strong enough
to complete your ruin.” The Boston port bill passed, and the first
blood was spilt at Lexington.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to review in detail the Revolution. Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.</p>

<p>On the 2d of August, 1786, as the king was alighting from his carriage
at the gate of St. James, an attempt was made on his life by a
woman named Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting
a petition, endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed
in the paper. The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on
striking the vest of the king, it bent double, and thus preserved his
life. On the 29th of October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding
to the House of Lords, a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.
On his return to St. James the mob threw stones into the carriage,
several of which struck the king, and one lodged in the cuff of
his coat. The state carriage was completely demolished by the mob.
But it was on the 15th of May, 1800, that George the Third made his
narrowest escapes. In the morning of that day, whilst attending the
field exercise of a battalion of guards, one of the soldiers loaded his
piece with a bullet and discharged it at the king. The ball fortunately
missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a gentleman who was standing
in the rear. In the evening of the same day a more alarming circumstance
occurred at the Drury Lane Theater. At the moment when
the king entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the right-hand side
of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a large horse-pistol
at him. The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown up
by a by-stander, and the ball entered the box just above the head
of the king.</p>

<p>Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_693"></a>[693]</span>
He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and
on the 20th of December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic. In this
dreadful condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having
been the most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever
disgraced the English throne. He was forgotten as soon as life left
his body, and was hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but
too often attends a despot to the grave.</p>

<p>The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the
last resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness
to one of light.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the career of Washington. Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried in his hand, like Atropos, the destinies
of millions; he bore on his shoulders, like Atlas, the weight of a
world. It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent
career. Honored again and again by the people of the land he had
redeemed from thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side
of the wisest and best of the world’s benefactors. Assassins did not
unglory him in life, nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in
death. The names of his great battlefields have become nursery words,
and his principles have imbedded themselves forever in the national
character. Every pulsation of our hearts beats true to his memory.
His mementoes are everywhere around and about us. Distant as we
are from the green fields of his native Westmoreland, the circle of his
renown has spread far beyond our borders. In climes where the torch
of science was never kindled; on shores still buried in primeval bloom;
amongst barbarians where the face of liberty was never seen, the
Christian missionary of America, roused perhaps from his holy duties
by the distant echo of the national salute, this day thundering amidst
the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the gleam of his country’s banner,
this day floating in every wind of heaven, pauses over his task as
a Christian, and whilst memory kindles in his bosom the fires of
patriotism, pronounces in the ear of the enslaved pagan the venerated
name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.</p>

<p>Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan head, wherever treason
shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion shall unfurl its tattered
ensign, there, oh there, sow his deeds in the hearts of patriots and
republicans. For from these there shall spring, as from the dragon’s
teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the plains of Heber, vast armies of
invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar and tomb at Mount Vernon, to
live as freemen, or as such to die!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_694"></a>[694]</span></p>

<h5>THE LESSONS OF THE TRAGEDY</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>The Murder of President McKinley</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By David Starr Jordan</span></p>

<p>We meet to-day under the sway of a number of different emotions.
We would express our sorrow at the untimely death of a good man.
We would show our regret that our nation has lost the Chief Magistrate
of its choice. We would express our sympathy with the gentle
woman who has been suddenly bereft of the kindest and most considerate
of husbands. We are filled with shame that in our Republic, the
land where all men are free and equal wherever they behave themselves
as men, the land which has no rulers save the public servants
of its own choosing, a deed like this should be possible. We would
express our detestation of that kind of political and social agitation
which finds no method of working reform save through intimidation
and killing. We would wish to find the true lessons of this event and
would not let even the least of them fall on our ears unheeded.</p>

<p>And one plain lesson in this: Under democracy all violence is treason.
Whosoever throws a stone at a scab teamster, whosoever fires a
shot at the President of the United States, is an enemy of the Republic.
He is guilty of high treason in his heart, and treason in thought
works itself out in lawlessness of action.</p>

<p>The central fact of all democracy is agreement with law. It is our
law; we have made it. If it is wrong we can change it, but the compact
of democracy is that we change it in peace. “The sole source of
power under God is the consent of the governed.” This was written
by Cromwell across the statute books of Parliament. This our fathers
wrote in other words in our own Constitution. The will of the people
is the sole source of any statute you or I may be called on to obey.
It is the decree of no army, the dictum of no president. It is the
work of no aristocracy; not of blood nor of wealth. It is simply our
own understanding that we have to do right, shall behave justly, shall
live and let our neighbor live. If our law is tyrannous, it is our ignorance
which has made it so. Let it pinch a little and we shall find out
what hurts us. Then it will be time to change. Laws are made
through the ballot, and through the ballot we can unmake them. There
is no other honest way, no other way that is safe, and no other way
that is effective. To break the peace is to invite tyranny. Lawlessness
is the expression of weakness, of ignorance, of unpatriotism. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_695"></a>[695]</span>
tyranny provokes anarchy, so does anarchy necessitate tyranny. Confusion
brings the man on horseback. It was to keep away both anarchy
and tyranny that the public school was established in America.</p>

<p>Three times has our nation been called upon to pass into the shadow
of humiliation, and each time in the past it has learned its severe
lesson. When Lincoln fell, slavery perished. To the American of
to-day human slavery in a land of civilization is almost an impossible
conception, yet many of us who think ourselves still young can remember
when half of this land held other men in bondage and the dearest
hope of freedom was that such things should not go on forever. I can
remember when we looked forward to the time when “at least the
present form of slavery should be no more.” For democracy and slavery
could not subsist together. The Union could not stand—half
slave, half free.</p>

<p>The last words of Garfield were these: <i>Strangulatus pro Republica</i>.
(Slain for the Republic.) The feudal tyranny of the spoils system
which had made republican administration a farce, has not had, since
Garfield’s time, a public defender. It has not vanished from our politics,
but its place is where it belongs—among the petty wrongs of
maladministration.</p>

<p>Again a president is slain for the Republic—and the lesson is the
homely one of peace and order, patience and justice, respect for ourselves
through respect for the law, for public welfare, and for public
right.</p>

<p>For this country is passing through a time of storm and stress, a
flurry of lawless sensationalism. The irresponsible journalism, the
industrial wars, the display of hastily-gotten wealth, the grasping monopoly,
the walking delegate, the vulgar cartoon, the foul-mouthed agitator,
the sympathetic strike, the unsympathetic lockout, are all symptoms
of a single disease—the loss of patriotism, the decay of the sense
of justice. As in other cases, the symptoms feed the disease, as well
as indicate it. The deed of violence breeds more deeds of violence;
anarchy provokes hysteria, and hysteria makes anarchy. The unfounded
scandal sets a hundred tongues to wagging, and the seepage
from the gutter reaches a thousand homes.</p>

<p>The journal for the weak-minded and debased makes heroes of those
of its class who carry folly over into crime. The half-crazy egotist
imagines himself a regicide, and his neighbor with the clean shirt is his
oppressor and therefore his natural victim. Usually his heart fails
him, and his madness spends itself in foul words. Sometimes it does
not, and the world stands aghast. But it is not alone against the Chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696"></a>[696]</span>
Magistrate that these thoughts and deeds are directed. There are
usually others within closer range. There is scarcely a man in our
country, prominent in any way, statesman, banker, merchant, railway
manager, clergyman, teacher even, that has not, somewhere, his
would-be Nemesis, some lunatic, with a sensational newspaper and a
pistol, prepared to take his life.</p>

<p>The gospel of discontent has no place within our Republic. It is
true, as has often been said, that discontent is the cause of human
progress. It is truer still, as Mr. John P. Irish has lately pointed out,
that discontent may be good or bad, according to its relation to the
individual man. There is a noble discontent which a man turns
against himself. It leads the man who fails to examine his own weaknesses,
to make the needed repairs in himself, then to take up the struggle
again. There is a cowardly discontent which leads a man to blame
all failure on his prosperous neighbor or on society at large, as if a
social system existed apart from the men who make it. This is the
sort of discontent to which the agitator appeals, that finds its stimulus
in sensational journalism. It is that which feeds the frenzy of the
assassin who would work revenge on society by destroying its accepted
head.</p>

<p>It is not theoretical anarchism or socialism or any other “ism” which
is responsible for this. Many of the gentlest spirits in the world today
call themselves anarchists, because they look forward to the time
when personal meekness shall take the place of all statutes. The gentle
anarchism of the optimistic philosopher is not that which confronts
us to-day. It is the anarchy of destruction, the hatred of class for
class; a hatred that rests only on distorted imagination, for, after all
is said, there are no classes in America. It is the hatred imported from
the Old World, excited by walking delegates whose purpose it is to
carry a torch through society; a hatred fanned by agitators of whatever
sort, unpractical dreamers or conscienceless scoundrels, exploited
in the newspapers, abetted by so-called high society with its display of
shoddy and greed, and intensified by the cold, hard selfishness that
underlies the power of the trust. All these people, monopolists, social
leaders, walking delegates, agitators, sensationalists, dreamers, are
alien to our ways, outside the scope of our democracy, and enemies to
good citizenship.</p>

<p>The real Americans, trying to live their lives in their own way, saving
a little of their earnings and turning the rest into education and
enjoyment, have many grievances in these days of grasping trusts and
lawless unions. But of such free Americans our country is made.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_697"></a>[697]</span>
They are the people, not the trusts or the unions, nor their sensational
go-betweens. This is their government, and the government of the
people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the
earth. This is the people’s President—our President—who was killed,
and it is ours to avenge him.</p>

<p>Not by lynch law on a large or small scale may we do it; not
by anarchy or despotism; not by the destruction of all that call
themselves anarchists, not by abridging freedom of the press nor by
checking freedom of speech. Those who would wreak lawless vengeance
on the anarchists are themselves anarchists and makers of
anarchists.</p>

<p>We have laws enough already without making more for men to
break. Let us get a little closer to the higher law. Let us respect our
own rights and those of our neighbor a little better. Let us cease to
tolerate sensational falsehood about our neighbor, or vulgar abuse of
those in power. If we have bad rulers, let us change them peacefully.
Let us put an end to every form of intimidation, wherever practiced.
The cause that depends upon hurling bricks or epithets, or upon clubbing
teamsters or derailing trains, cannot be a good cause. Even if
originally in the right, the act of violence puts the partisans of such a
cause in the wrong. No freeman ever needs to do such things as these.
For the final meaning of democracy is peace on earth, good-will towards
men. When we stand for justice among ourselves we can demand
justice of the monopolistic trust. When we attack it with clear
vision and cool speech we shall find the problem of combination for
monopoly not greater than any other. And large or small, there is but
one way for us to meet any problem: to choose wise men, clean men,
cool men, the best we can secure through our method of the ballot,
and then to trust the rest in their hands. The murder of the President
has no direct connection with industrial war. Yet there is this connection,
that all war, industrial or other, loosens the bonds of order,
destroys mutual respect and trust, gives inspiration to anarchy, pushes
a foul thought on to a foul word, a foul word on to a foul deed.</p>

<p>We trust now that the worst has come, the foulest deed has been
committed, that our civil wars may stop, not through the victory of one
side over the other, the trusts or the unions now set off against each
other, but in the victory over both of the American people, of the
great body of men and women who must pay for all, and who are the
real sufferers in every phase of the struggle.</p>

<p><i>Strangulatus pro Republica</i>—slain for the republic. The lesson is
plain. It is for us to take it into our daily lives. It is the lesson of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_698"></a>[698]</span>
peace and good-will, the lesson of manliness and godliness. Let us
take it to ourselves, and our neighbors will take it from us.</p>

<p>All civilized countries are ruled by public opinion. If there be a
lapse in our civic duties, it is due to a lapse in our keenness of vision,
our devotion to justice. This means a weakening of the individual
man, the loss of the man himself in the movements of the mass.
Perhaps the marvelous material development of our age, the achievements
of huge coöperation which science has made possible, has overshadowed
the importance of the individual man. If so, we have only
to reassert ourselves. It is of men, individual men, clear-thinking,
God-fearing, sound-acting men, and of these alone, that great nations
can be made.—From “The Voice of the Scholar,” by kind permission of

<h5>WHAT IS TO BE THE DESTINY OF THIS REPUBLIC</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Judge Story</span></p>

<p>When we reflect on what has been and what is, how is it possible
not to feel a profound sense of the responsibilities of this republic to
all future ages! What vast motives press upon us for lofty efforts!
What brilliant prospects invite our enthusiasm! What solemn warnings
at once demand our vigilance and moderate our confidence!</p>

<p>The old world has already revealed to us, in its unsealed books, the
beginning and end of all its marvelous struggles in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>Greece! lovely Greece! “the land of scholars and the nurse of
arms,” where sister republics, in fair processions, chanted the praise
of liberty and the good—where and what is she? For two thousand
years the oppressors have bound her to the earth. Her arts are no
more. The last sad relics of her temples are but the barracks of a
ruthless soldiery; the fragments of her columns and her palaces are in
the dust, yet beautiful in ruin. She fell not when the mighty were upon
her. Her sons were united at Thermopylæ and Marathon; and the
tide of her triumph rolled back upon the Hellespont. She was conquered
by her own factions. She fell by the hands of her own people.
The man of Macedonia did not the work of destruction. It was
already done by her own corruptions, banishments, and dissensions.</p>

<p>Rome! republican Rome! whose eagles glanced in the rising and
setting sun,—where and what is she? The eternal city yet remains,
proud even in her desolation, noble in her decline, venerable in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_699"></a>[699]</span>
majesty of religion, and calm as in the composure of death. The
malaria has traveled in the parts won by the destroyers. More
than eighteen centuries have mourned over the loss of the empire. A
mortal disease was upon her before Cæsar had crossed the Rubicon;
and Brutus did not restore her health by the deep probings of the
senate-chamber. The Goths, and Vandals, and Huns, the swarms of
the north, completed only what was begun at home. Romans betrayed
Rome. The legions were bought and sold, but the people offered the
tribute-money.</p>

<p>And where are the republics of modern times, which cluster around
immortal Italy? Venice and Genoa exist but in name. The Alps, indeed,
look down upon the brave and peaceful Swiss, in their native
fastnesses; but, the guarantee of their freedom is in their weakness,
and not in their strength. The mountains are not easily crossed, and
the valleys are not easily retained. When the invader comes, he moves
like an avalanche, carrying destruction in his path. The peasantry sink
before him. The country, too, is too poor for plunder, and too rough
for a valuable conquest. Nature presents her eternal barrier on every
side, to check the wantonness of ambition. And Switzerland remains,
with her simple institutions, a military road to climates scarcely worth
a permanent possession, and protected by the jealousy of her
neighbors.</p>

<p>We stand the latest, and, if we fall, probably the last experiment of
self-government by the people. We have begun it under circumstances
of the most auspicious nature. We are in the vigor of youth. Our
growth has never been checked by the oppression of tyranny. Our
constitutions never have been enfeebled by the vice or the luxuries of
the world. Such as we are, we have been from the beginning, simple,
hardy, intelligent, accustomed to self-government and self-respect.
The Atlantic rolls between us and a formidable foe. Within our own
territory, stretching through many degrees of latitude, we have the
choice of many products, and many means of independence. The government
is mild. The press is free. Religion is free. Knowledge
reaches or may reach every home. What fairer prospects of success
could be presented? What means more adequate to accomplish the
sublime end? What more is necessary than for the people to preserve
what they themselves have created?</p>

<p>Already has the age caught the spirit of our institutions. It has
already ascended the Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both oceans.
It has infused itself into the life-blood of Europe, and warmed the
sunny plains of France and the lowlands of Holland. It has touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_700"></a>[700]</span>
the philosophy of the north, and, moving onward to the south, has
opened to Greece the lesson of her better days.</p>

<p>Can it be, that America, under such circumstances, can betray herself?
That she is to be added to the catalogue of republics, the inscription
upon whose ruin is: “They were, but they are not!” Forbid it,
my countrymen: forbid it, Heaven!</p>

<p>I call upon you, fathers, by the shades of your ancestors, by the dear
ashes which repose in this precious soil, by all you are, and all you
hope to be, resist every project of disunion; resist every attempt to
fetter your consciences, or smother your public schools, or extinguish
your system of public instruction.</p>

<p>I call upon you, mothers, by that which never fails in woman, the
love of your offspring, to teach them, as they climb your knees, or lean
on your bosoms, the blessings of liberty. Swear them at the altar, as
with their baptismal vows, to be true to their country, and never forsake
her.</p>

<p>I call upon you, young men, to remember whose sons you are—whose
inheritance you possess. Life can never be too short, which brings
nothing but disgrace and oppression. Death never comes too soon, if
necessary in defense of the liberties of our country.</p>

<h5>MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>An oration delivered in San Francisco, May 30, 1901.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Samuel M. Shortridge</span></p>

<p>This day is consecrate to the nation’s dead and living soldiers.
Uncovered beside the hallowed graves of those who fought and fell in
the sacred cause of Union and Liberty, a people of brave men and loyal
women stand with hearts oppressed with gratitude, and listen to the
story of their heroes’ deeds and death. We come in thankfulness—matron
and maid, sire and lad—to scatter fragrant flowers on the
honored dust, and for the martyrs who sleep unknown but not unwept.
We come to grasp the hands of the surviving heroes who responded
to their country’s cry of anguish when the temple of liberty was
assailed and her sacred altars desecrated; who endured the long,
weary march, the cruel deprivations of the camp, the fevered heat of
noon and the chilling cold at night; who stormed the frowning heights
where treason was intrenched, and met upon an hundred fields the
brave but misguided hosts that in madness and folly sought to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_701"></a>[701]</span>
the edifice dedicated with the prayers and consecrated by the valor
and blood of the patriot fathers; who carried the tattered but dear
flag of their country through fire and flood and the “valley and shadow
of death,” and paused not until it waved victorious in every state and
was respected on every sea. We come to shed proud and happy tears
for those who gladly gave up all for their imperiled country, in order to
preserve the precious fruits of the Revolutionary struggle and to keep
the flag of Washington triumphant in the sky. We come to welcome
and to dower with our love the loyal and self-sacrificing men who left
the plow, the forge, the desk, to rescue from the jaws of death the
greatest, best, and truest republic that ever blessed the earth.</p>

<p>A common thought pervades all hearts. This is not a day for vainglorious
boasting, but for gratitude and praise. We come in sorrow,
not in anger, and our hearts are filled with sadness, not revenge. We
are not here to upbraid, to accuse, to exult over the defeat of brethren
and brave men, to denounce what is no more, to open wounds by the
healing touch of Time made whole. No, no; Heaven forbid that this
sacred day should stir our hearts to other than feelings of forgiveness,
of gratitude, of pride, and of love. Rather let it be said we come to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raze out the written troubles of the brain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For those who died to save the republic, I have tears and eulogy; for
those who died to overthrow it, I have tears and silence.</p>

<p>Not as citizens of a torn and discordant Union, not as blinded partisans,
but as children of a common and reunited country, we gather
to give expression of our gratitude to those who by their sacrifices and
their martyrdom made this land the home of freedom, and the banner
of the stars the symbol of one people, one constitution, and one destiny.</p>

<p>We are gathered here—the multitude has put on a suit of woe and
stands beside the graves where heroes sleep—not to revive bitter memories,
not to cause heartaches or awaken animosities, dead, let us fervently
hope, forever, but for a better, worthier, and more patriotic purpose:
to teach the rising generation that the dead fell not in vain; to
impress upon their youthful hearts that America does not forget the
travail through which, by the inscrutable wisdom of Heaven, she has
passed, that she loves her loyal sons and daughters with more than
Cornelian affection, and treasures them now, and will treasure them
forever, as her unfading glory.</p>

<p>And so, my countrymen, we come to sorrow and to rejoice,—to sorrow
over the loved and lost, to rejoice over their magnificent achievements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_702"></a>[702]</span>
and a Union saved and disenthralled by their devotion. As in
the Roman days the wives and mothers went out upon the Appian Way
to meet the home-returning legions,—some to fall upon the bosoms of
husbands, fathers, or sons, and shed tears of joy, and some to search
in vain for dear ones amid the broken, decimated ranks, but wept not,
because they had died bravely in defense of Rome, her altars, and her
fires,—so we welcome to-day the scarred and wounded, the remnant
of hard-fought fields; we stretch forth our arms to embrace them; we
cover them with garlands emblematic of our love, and scatter flowers
in their way to tread upon.</p>

<p>But for the ones who answer not, who sleep the dreamless sleep of
death, who died with the face of mother near their hearts, the name
of country on their lips, what shall we say? They cannot hear our
words nor see the offering of our hands; they are past all battles, all
marches, all victories, all defeats; “on Fame’s eternal camping-ground
their silent tents are spread,” and the troubled drum disturbs their
sleep no more. And yet, O sacred shades of the unreplying dead, we
feel your presence now. We hear the shot of Sumter that wakened
all the land; we see you coming down from the mountains, up from
the plains, and marching away to battle, leaving behind, alas; forever,
faithful wife, loving children, aged mother, venerable father; we see
you by the campfires dimly burning; we see you in the cannon-smoke
and hurricane of war; we hear the command to charge, which you
obey, how bravely, with bosom bared and parched, thirsty lips; we
see you wounded and bleeding; we see you in the hospitals of fever
and pain; we see you again with your regiment, with courage undaunted,
your love of home and flag intensified; we see your comrades
fall around you like flowers of spring cut down; we see you captured
and hurried away; we see you wasting in awful dungeons, languishing
in prison-pens; we catch the faint accent of your tongues as you murmur
a prayer for your country and for the loved ones that come to
you in your dreams; we see you encounter death in the gaunt and
hideous form of starvation and quail not; we see you die! Die for
what? Die for whom? Die for Union and Liberty. Die for us and
generations yet to be.</p>

<p>Dead and living soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic, you,
you engaged in the holiest cause that ever received the approving smile
of Heaven; you preserved the Union, “One and inseparable,” with all
its blessed memories, with all its priceless benefits, with all its exalted
and encouraging hopes. You carried the banner of your country, full
high advanced through the darkest hour and wildest storm that ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_703"></a>[703]</span>
overwhelmed a nation, until the returning and radiant morn of victory
and peace blessed and hallowed it. Moved by the loftiest purposes,
inspired by the sublimest sentiments, faithful unto death, you went
forth, not to subjugate, not to enslave, not to tear down, but to rescue,
to uplift, and to make the name of that liberty for which Warren died
and to preserve which Lincoln gave the full measure of his devotion;
in the name of all we are and hope to be,—the glorious present and
the grander future,—we bow to-day and pay you the poor tribute of our
love and tears.</p>

<p>All hail to the saviors of this beloved land! Humbly we lay our
offerings on the dead. Reverently we invoke the blessing of Almighty
God on the declining years of the living. Long may their eyes be
gladdened by the flag they saved; long may their hearts be consoled
by the assurance that, while the monuments reared to haughty pride
and selfish ambition sink beneath the despoiling hand of time, the soldier’s
humble grave, though unadorned by costly urn or marble shaft,
will forever be his country’s hallowed ground, where future patriots
shall come to rekindle the fires of their devotion and to renew and
reaffirm their allegiance to the land by his sacrifices made truly, grandly
free. And so we bow before the heroes who saved our country; we
stand uncovered beside the graves of the martyrs who died in her
sacred cause. Peace and honor to the living; honor and peace to
the dead.</p>

<p>The Civil War, of the sad ravages and awful agony of which we are
this day reminded, was the inevitable result of the “irrepressible conflict
between opposing and enduring forces,”—between freedom and
slavery.</p>

<p>Removed sufficiently from those troublous days to look at facts
calmly and to speak of them without anger, let us be just, let us be
truthful. The courts had exalted slavery, had hedged it round by law,
and nationalized it. In that most august tribunal—in that high place
immortalized by the transcendent greatness of a Marshall and the
unfathomed learning of a Story, which had witnessed the marvelous
displays of oratory of Pinckney, Webster and Choate—in the Supreme
Court of the United States—slavery met and vanquished freedom.
The Dred Scott decision gave up this nation to bondage, and made it
possible, under the law, to sell wives and babes in Faneuil Hall and
to call the roll of slaves on the sacred spot where Warren fell!
Thenceforth Congress could not interfere with slavery; states were
powerless to prevent it. And thus it came to pass that in the land of
Washington, Franklin, and Wayne, in the land of Adams, Henry, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_704"></a>[704]</span>
Sherman, in the land whose sons died for liberty on a hundred fields—who
stormed the walls of Quebec and left their blood on the snow
at Valley Forge—in this our beloved land—in this republic—slavery
was king. The time to gather the bitter fruit of the accursed upas
tree planted at Jamestown in 1620 was near at hand.</p>

<p>An awful storm, pregnant with death and woe, was gathering, and
the people sought a leader. They were sore distressed with a multitude
of counsel, and they cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God give us men! A time like this demands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and willing hands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Men whom the lust of office does not kill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Men who possess opinions and a will;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Men who have honor; men who will not lie;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Men who can stand before a demagogue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In public duty and in private thinking!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For while the tricksters, with their thumb-worn creeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their large professions, and their little deeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the midst of mingled doubts and fears, when weak and timid
politicians masquerading under the name of statesmen hesitated to
grapple with the monstrous evil that threatened to advance upon and
overwhelm the last remaining bulwarks of freedom, when the right
and true path was well nigh lost sight of, and lovers of liberty were
ranged under different banners, waiting for a Moses who should lead
them out of Egyptian bondage, the Great Captain came. He came,
and thenceforth all seemed clear. Simple in speech, plain in manner,
straightforward in action, tender as a child, bold as a lion, fearless as
a hero, at once courageous and humble, lofty and lowly, he came to
speak and to act. Born of Southern parents who had witnessed the
depressing and blighting effects of slavery, and reared in the broad
prairies of the West, whose very winds sang Liberty, he realized the
curse of bondage and the blessing of freedom. From the unfelled
forest, from the log cabin and the country store, from humble forum
and obscure dwelling, from out the ranks of the people, the Leader
came. He came, and statesmen bowed before him; he spoke, and a
nation hearkened to his counsel. Devoted to truth and the right, opposed
to falsehood and the wrong, scorning the tricks and subterfuges
of the self-seeking, and abhorring with his whole heart and soul the
mean and base, loving his country with a devotion that made him forgetful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_705"></a>[705]</span>
of all else save the preservation of the Union, the incomparable
Leader rose. In judicial tribunal and halls of state, in capital and
village, in mansion and log cabin, in crowded cities, and out on the
boundless prairies of the West, men listened to his words, and saw, as
they had never seen before, the darkness, the light, the path,—the
wrong, the right, and the remedy. “You must be either all slave or
all free.” These were his prophetic words. Who was this man that
came unheralded out of the West? Who was this man that rose above
the great statesmen of his day—who was as earnest as Phillips, as
gifted as Baker, who was more profound than Seward, more learned
than Chase, more logical than Douglas, more eloquent than Everett?
Who was he that combined in one soul the simplicity of a child, the
wisdom of a sage, and the foresight of a prophet? Need I utter his
sacred name? Wheresoever among men there is a love for disinterested
patriotism and sublime attachment to duty, wheresoever liberty
is worshiped and loyalty exalted, his name and deeds are known. His
image is in all hearts, his name to-day is on all lips. That grand and
lofty man was the rail-splitter of Illinois,—beloved, sainted, immortal
Abraham Lincoln, statesman, philosopher, and patriot, the greatest,
noblest, purest soul that ever was enwrapped in clay, to walk the earth,—Abraham
Lincoln, the emancipator of a race; the savior of the Union!</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the election of the Presidency of this great and
good and just man was the signal for revolt. “In your hands,” said he
in his first inaugural address,—“In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,
and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.
You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.
You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government,
while I shall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect, and defend’
it.”</p>

<p>But the blow was struck,—the blow that was ultimately to destroy
slavery, and make our country free indeed,—“a land without a serf, a
servant, or a slave.”</p>

<p>The war to preserve the integrity of the nation was marked by great
battles, weary marches, long sieges, and splendid deeds of daring.
Brave men met brave men, and gallant soldiers stormed forts and
heights by gallant soldiers defended. If America wept for the folly
and madness of some, yet was she proud of the courage of all her
sons. We think to-night of the mighty struggle that ended with
Appomattox’s cloudless day; of all the fields where saber flashed, and
cannon roared, and patriot sons sealed their devotion with their blood.
The world knows the result. Freedom triumphed. The Union was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_706"></a>[706]</span>
saved, Liberty survived, slavery perished and is dead upon our soil
forevermore,—dead by the sword of immortal Grant, “dead by the
hand of Abraham Lincoln, dead by the justice of Almighty God.”</p>

<p>Rejoice, O human hearts and human lips, that Liberty survived.
Rejoice, O men of the North, that slavery is dead. Rejoice, O men
of the South, that slavery is dead. Rejoice, O sons of the Republic,
that the crown was restored to the brow of liberty, that, reunited and
reconciled, loyal and true, we stand to-day, hand in hand, heart beating
with heart, under the blessed and ever-triumphant banner of the Union.</p>

<p>And thus may we ever stand,—one people, one nation,—no North,
no South, no East; no West,—one altar, one love, one hope.</p>

<p>And thus may we ever stand,—brothers in peace, brothers in war,—and
“highly resolved that government of the people, by the people, and
for the people shall not perish from the earth.”</p>

<p>And thus may we ever stand,—a Union of hearts and of states, and
“teach men that Liberty is not a mockery, and a republic is not another
name for feebleness and anarchy.”</p>

<p>And standing thus, the world cannot prevail against us in war or in
peace.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, in this hour of mourning we may without impropriety
indulge ourselves in feelings of pride over the glorious deeds of our
heroes dead and living. Pittsburgh Landing, Chattanooga, and Vicksburg;
Lookout Mountain, Gettysburg, and Antietam; the Wilderness,
Atlanta, and Richmond,—all are eternal witnesses to the deathless valor
and sublime courage of those upon whose graves we have tenderly laid
our flowers and upon whose brows we have lovingly placed the laurel
wreath of victory and peace. No poor words of mine can tell them
of our love or add unto their fame; the one is unspeakable, the other
as broad and all-comprehensive as the earth, as high and spotless as
the stars.</p>

<p>Upon the hearts of many heroes who made our country free—who
with their blood washed away the ebon blot on our country’s shield—inexorable
death has laid his hand, and the high and the low, the
mighty general and the humble private, repose alike in the equal grave.
All-conquering “time, the tomb-builder,” is day by day mustering out
the noble army that went forth to save, to make and to preserve us a
nation. Halleck, Thomas, Meade, McClellan, Hancock, McDowell,
Garfield, Logan, Sheridan, Sherman, Harrison, Porter, McKinley,—all
have been gathered to their fathers, gone to grasp the hands of their
comrades on the peaceful shores of Eternal Rest.</p>

<p>But of him, the simple, silent, steadfast man; of him that marshaled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_707"></a>[707]</span>
order out of chaos, gave direction to mighty armies and led them to
final victory; of him who made the Emancipation Proclamation of
Abraham Lincoln a glorious reality, and eternal fact which broke the
chains that held a race in bondage; of him who bore his great honors
so modestly and meekly in war and peace; of him who by his genius
added to our arms a luster as imperishable as his fame, and left his
countrymen the priceless legacy of an untarnished and immortal name;
of him who was ambitious, not as a Cæsar, not as a Napoleon, but as
a Washington, with no higher aim, no loftier purpose, than to serve
his country, not to wear a crown; of him who stood before uncovered
kings and was saluted by the emperors of the earth, but never forgot
his humble origin nor lost his sympathy for the poor and lowly; of him
whose deeds, from duty and necessity, not from choice, were war, but
whose heart ever yearned, whose voice ever pleaded, for peace,—what
human tongue can speak of the spotless, peerless General Grant? His
mighty work is done, his triumphal march is ended, his name is for all
time. Reverently and tenderly we lay our flowers upon his tomb to-day;
gratefully and lovingly we breathe his sacred name. Calm, cool,
and undaunted, victorious in war, magnanimous in peace,—</p>

<p>But of the rank and file, of the unknown dead, what can be said?
Sleep on, O humble soldier boy, sleep on! No more shall the midnight
attack, the fierce charge, or the bugle-call to arms rouse thee from
thy rest. Sleep on in thy lowly sepulcher, guarded by thy country’s
tenderest love and pillowed on her grateful heart. Whether it be beneath
polished marble and sculptured alabaster reared by the hands
of affection, or beneath the green sod watered by tears of love; whether
it be beneath rich, fragrant flowers blooming in perennial freshness
and cared for by dear ones left behind, or in the lonely, pathless woods
where in darkness and thick gloom you laid down your life; whether
it be in fertile valley where your life blood reddened the grass of the
meadow, or in the intrenchment of death, facing the pitiless storm of
shot and shell; whether it be in the prison-pen, where your heart-throbs
grew faint, but your undying love for the Stars and Stripes
could not be seduced into deserting your country, or in sultry mountain-passes
where you wearied of the march, and, fever-stricken, fell
down to die,—wheresoever it be, on land or in ocean depth, O humble
soldier boy, sleep on! Thy cause was liberty; thy purpose, Union;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_708"></a>[708]</span>
thy object, a nation purged and purified of slavery. Thy great deeds
are thy eternal monument. Written on the nation’s heart and in the
everlasting Book of Life thy name shall live forevermore, fadeless to
eternity.</p>

<p>My countrymen, one and all,—if enemies in the dark days of
estrangement, brothers now and forever,—let us rejoice that under
God we have a reunited country, that the Union was preserved, that
Liberty, crowned and sceptered, sits enthroned in the constitution; and
with our eyes fixed on the one and only banner of the loyal heart, let
us reverently resolve to show ourselves in some measure worthy of our
ancestors and our brethren who fought and died to make this blessed
land the home of freedom, free lips and free hands, forever.</p>

<p>The dead soldiers of the republic, the heroes of the Revolution, the
heroes of 1812, the heroes of 1848, the heroes of 1861, the heroes of
1898,—they sleep in glory. But what of the living? O soldiers of the
republic, wheresoe’er you are to-night, on land or sea, in frigid north
or torrid south, on frontier guarding the outposts of civilization, or
in far Luzon defending with sleepless vigilance the flag of our hearts,
God bless you and keep you. Be of good cheer. Your country believes
in you and loves you. If you return, she will clasp you close to her
heart and bestow on you the rewards of peace; if you fall fighting her
battles, she will be mother to your children and treasure you as she
treasures those who preserved the flag you have lifted and hold on high.</p>

<p>My countrymen, the heroes of every battlefield of the republic—from
Bunker Hill to Santiago—look down to-night from their portals of
eternal light and beseech us to be true to the principles in vindication
of which they died. Nay, more: from every land made sacred by
heroism, from every dungeon of agony and death where truth has suffered
on the rack for conscience’ sake, from Marathon and Thermopylæ,
from Runnymede and Bannockburn, from the graves of Kosciusko
and Hampden, from the scaffolds of Sidney and Emmet, comes
a voice beseeching us to be faithful to our mission, to guard jealously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_709"></a>[709]</span>
the citadel of Liberty, and to vindicate by our wisdom and righteousness
and justice the holy cause of Freedom.</p>

<p>Oh! can we stand unmoved when thus addressed? Let us heed
these warning voices and hearken to these solemn admonitions, and
here and now, on this Memorial Day, with all the memories and lessons
of the past fresh in our hearts, let us renew our devotion and
reaffirm our allegiance to the cause of Liberty and Union, let us rededicate
and reconsecrate ourselves to the service of our Country.</p>

<p>How shall we fittingly commemorate the honored dead? When
Greece was threatened by the Persian army, Athens sent out a handful
of her bravest sons to meet the myriad hosts of Darius. Oh! the
intrepid courage, the sublime patriotism, of that Grecian band as they
advanced across the plain of Marathon with leveled spears to fall upon
the heathen horde that came to plunder and destroy. To commemorate
the splendid victory of Miltiades over Darius, of enlightened civilization
over brutish barbarism, the Athenians erected a mound on that
historic plain, and as a special and the highest mark of honor buried
their heroes where they had fallen. The light of Athens has gone
out forever; her glory has departed, never to return; her power has
vanished, never to be regained; the voice of her sublime philosophers
and peerless orators is heard no more; the language of Homer and
Demosthenes lives only in immortal type, the priceless heritage of the
human race; the matchless art of Phidias and Praxiteles is of the past,
and the unapproached masterpieces of the Parthenon have been eaten
away by the gnawing tooth of irreverent time; a melancholy gloom of
utter desolation and departed splendor broods over the “City of the
Violet Crown,” the once first and proudest city in the world. But,
after a lapse of more than twenty centuries,—centuries which have seen
the death of the old and the birth of the new civilizations, the rise and
fall of dynasties, the creation and decay of empires,—after a lapse of
more than twenty centuries the earthen mound at Marathon still remains,
clad to-day in the flowers of spring, an eternal witness to the
valor and heroism of Athens, a solemn reminder that those who die
in defense of Liberty and Country shall not perish from the memory
of men.</p>

<p>Let the monument to our heroes be the land they saved, domed and
canopied by the heavens that smiled upon their cause. For so long as
the sun in his coming kisses and glorifies that blessed banner, or,
sinking, burnishes our mountain tops with crimson gold; so long as
yonder waves roll inward to break and die upon the shore; so long
as the American heart beats to the transports of a true and lofty patriotism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_710"></a>[710]</span>
or man has aspirations of light and liberty; so long as the
nation lives; so long as the flag of Washington and Lincoln is in the
sky,—even so long will our heroes’ fame survive and be an inspiration
to the Union’s sons forever and forever.</p>

<h5>SENATOR VEST’S EULOGY ON THE DOG</h5>

<p>“Gentlemen of the Jury: The best friend a man has in this world
may turn against him and become his enemy. His son and daughter
that he has reared with loving care may become ungrateful. Those
who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our
happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith.
The money that a man has he may lose. It flies away from him when
he may need it most. Man’s reputation may be sacrificed in a moment
of ill considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their
knees and do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw
the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads.
The one absolutely unselfish friend a man may have in this selfish
world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful
or treacherous, is the dog.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the Jury: A man’s dog stands by him in prosperity
and poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold
ground, when the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if
only he may be near his master’s side. He will kiss the hand that has
no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter
with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his
pauper master as if he were a prince.</p>

<p>“When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take
wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his love as the
sun in its journey through the heavens. If fortune drives the master
forth an outcast into the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful
dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard
him against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last
scene of all comes and death takes his master in its embrace and his
body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends
pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found,
his head between his paws and his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness,
faithful and true even to death.”</p>

<span class="smaller">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE AFTER-DINNER SPEAKER</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The practice of speaking at the banquet table is an ancient
custom. In modern life it is the most universally used form
of public speaking. Every educated man and woman sooner
or later will be expected to take part in post-prandial occasions.
This need not be an irksome task for any provided they
consider carefully a few vital essentials, keeping in mind that
the after-dinner speech is primarily to please. If it ever be
to instruct, it is that kind of instruction which comes by the
stimulation of our higher sensibilities.</p>

<p>Essentials:</p>

<p>1. Have something worth while to say.</p>

<p>2. This something must be appropriate to the occasion and
to the guests.</p>

<p>3. Know who are to be present and who are to speak.</p>

<p>4. Know how much time is allotted you.</p>

<p>5. Strive your utmost to enjoy yourself and let what you
say appear as a spontaneous outgrowth of your environment.</p>

<p>6. Avoid using old jokes and hackneyed quotations.</p>

<p>7. Avoid stiff formality. Radiate kindliness and good fellowship
toward all.</p>

<p>8. Do not apologize. Let your appreciations and the fact
that “some one else could have responded better,” that “you
are unprepared,” etc., be taken for granted. Don’t waste time
on these follies. Get down to business.</p>

<p>9. Have your speech carefully prepared and stick to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_712"></a>[712]</span></p>

<p>10. Remember that this is a time that reveals your true self,
so let the best in you shine forth.</p>

<p>Let us discuss more fully some of the more important essentials.
One should never begin his speech with an apology.
How boresome it is to hear a speaker express surprise at being
called upon; regretting he is totally unprepared; telling us
that some one else could have spoken on this subject far better
than he, etc., etc., etc. This is never in place and it is never
necessary. On one occasion many prominent men and women
were banqueting together in Chicago. Dr. George Vincent,
then a member of the faculty of the University of Chicago,
an orator himself of no mean ability, was toastmaster. A
program of unusual length had been prepared. Under any
ordinary chairman it would have kept the guests there until
morning. Dr. Vincent arose, and in a clear, brief and terse
introduction called attention to the long program. Then he
said, addressing the speakers who sat at his table: “Each of
you can give us the heart of your message in three, certainly
not more than four minutes. I shall expect you, therefore, to
go right to the heart of your subject. We will take it for
granted that you are not prepared, that some one else could
do better than you, and all the rest of the apologetic introductions.
The moment your time is up I shall bring down the
gavel as a forceful reminder that you must stop.”</p>

<p>The result was wonderful. Every speaker did as the chairman
required. The audience heard a dozen or more bright,
snappy addresses, full of thought and wit, with scarcely a redundant
word. What otherwise would have been a long,
tedious and wholly wearisome occasion was converted into a
function of grace, a noble inspiration and a never-to-be-forgotten
spiritual uplift.</p>

<p>Let the after-dinner speaker note that his speech should
seem to grow naturally out of the environment and fit the
occasion and the guests—that is, it should be <i>appropriate</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_713"></a>[713]</span>
The manner of presenting it should be <i>genial</i> and kindly.
This is no time or place to give vent to any personal animosity
or didacticism. There is no disposition, Nature says, for a
man with a well-filled stomach to digest heavy intellectual food.
He would much rather be amused and entertained—that is, the
occasion is a <i>convivial</i> one. Do not mistake this to mean triviality.
Above all things, whatever you say or whatever you
do, do not be frivolous. And finally that indispensable quality
<i>originality</i> should distinguish both the matter and the manner
of each speaker. This may mean nothing more than a new
way of presenting an old subject.</p>

<p>The very fact that an after-dinner speech should be short,
sparkling and fit the one who delivers it, makes it a difficult
form of public address, and consequently necessitates very
careful preparation. It is more than “to tell a joke, make a
platitude and give a quotation.” While the after-dinner speech
is supposed, primarily, to please, and <i>certainly should do so</i>, it
is often made the means of conveying the most forceful lessons
in business, religion, and patriotism. But when, in conveying
these lessons, the speaker becomes prosy, or <i>fails to
please</i>, he is out of place and should never have been invited.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="smaller">THE CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Nothing is of greater importance to the intelligent and
thoughtful man or woman who would become a public speaker
than the cultivation of the memory. Its pleasures and joys
are no less than its importance and usefulness. Well might
Richter exclaim: “Recollection is the only paradise from
which we cannot be turned out.” How it brings back to us
joys of sights, sounds and emotions. One has been thrilled
with a gorgeous landscape, a brilliant and vivid sunset, a majestic
mountain, a vision of feminine beauty, or an inspiring
exhibition of physical prowess. He has seen the proud march
of armed men, or the gathering of gay and happy throngs in
the public play-grounds and parks. A thousand memories of
sights bring back joys and delights of other days. So is it with
the memories of sounds—concerts, symphonies, stirring songs,
martial music, and the sweet voices of loved ones passed away.</p>

<p>It can readily be seen that memory is the practical basis of
all knowledge. Indeed there is no conscious knowledge without
memory. No man can think without it; there is no business
success; no writing, no poetry, no literature, no oratory,
no conversation, no music, no art, no psychology, no <i>anything
of mental life</i> without memory. Without memory there is no
identity. If I cannot remember myself of an hour ago, of
yesterday, of many yesterdays, I cannot be a personality. Life
would be disconnected and therefore incoherent and useless.</p>

<p>A poor memory is ever a hindrance if not a positive curse.
It is as if one’s legs should fail to bear him up when he starts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_715"></a>[715]</span>
to walk, run, leap, or as if his eyes should refuse to see, or saw
but dimly when he wished to observe. It is a never-ending
cause of confusion, embarrassment, irritation, and loss. No
man in any walk of life ever yet succeeded without a good
memory, and many a public speaker owes his success to his
always ready power over this faculty. Abraham Lincoln is a
striking example of this truth.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Stokes’s Golden Rule of Memory</span></h4>

<p>Psychologists have not yet determined what the memory is,
but all are agreed that it can be cultivated. A few general
propositions can be laid down, which, if faithfully followed,
are certain to bring desired results. Stokes, the great memory
teacher of the Royal Polytechnic Institution of London, formulated
his golden rule of memory as follows: “Observe,
reflect, link thought with thought, and think of the impressions.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Strengthening the Observation</span></h4>

<p>Careful observation is the basis of memory. To observe is
to regard with attention, to note with interest, in other words
<i>to see well</i>. How many people are there who see <i>well</i>? All
persons who are not blind can see, but do they see <i>well</i>? It
must be confessed that good observers are rare, and that is
one reason why good memories are rare. The discipline of
the observation is one of the most important ends of all mental
education. Teach a child to observe and he can and will
educate himself. Indeed he cannot help becoming educated.
Without discipline of the observation one may pass through
ten colleges and yet remain uneducated. What is the reason
the Indian can follow a trail so much better than a white man?
His life has depended upon his powers of observation. From
the earliest days of his dawning intelligence his perceptive faculties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_716"></a>[716]</span>
were aroused and highly developed by the struggle for
his very existence. He was compelled to watch the animals
in order that he might avoid those that were dangerous, and
catch those that were good for food; to follow the flying birds
that he might know when to trap them. He watched the fishes
as they spawned and hatched; the insects as they bored and
burrowed; the plants and trees as they grew and budded, blossomed
and seeded. The tracks of animals, whether upon the
sand, the snow, the mud, or more solid earth, soon became
familiar signs to him. All these and many other things in nature
he learned to know thoroughly in his simple and primitive
manner. This knowledge in his daily struggle for existence
came by means of his attention to details. Hence to the untrained
white man his powers of observation seem little short
of marvelous.</p>

<p>Children from their earliest years should be taught with
systematic persistence to cultivate this faculty. They should
be urged to tell all they can see in pictures. A table spread
with diverse articles covered with a cloth is also a good means
of disciplining close attention and memory. Let the children
stand around it and, after removing the cloth, give them a
minute, or less, for observation, then re-cover. Then give
each child a chance to tell how many articles there are; what
they are; and what is their relative position to each other, etc.
An intelligent teacher will invent a score of devices for cultivation
of the powers of observation, and nothing will better
repay her endeavors.</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher used to illustrate the difference between
observers and non-observers by telling a tale of two city
lads whom he once sent out into the country. One he called
“Eyes” and the other “No Eyes.” Each was to go to a certain
place and report upon what he saw. The one on his return
had seen little. The other—Eyes—was filled to overflowing
with the things he had observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_717"></a>[717]</span></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly due to the development of this faculty that
the hat-boys and hotel clerks are able to call the guests by name
and return to them their own belongings.</p>

<p>Read the novels of Frank Norris, of Jack London, of Winston
Churchill or any successful writer, the lines of any truly
great poet, and the ordinary mind cannot fail to be impressed
with the wonderful store of knowledge gleaned from a thousand
and one sources possessed by their writers. Think of
the wealth of observations poured forth by a Shakspere, a
Browning, a Goethe. Every page contains them by the score—observations
of facts in nature, art, science, literature, human
action, and indeed of everything under the sun. Hence, if
you would be an educated man you <i>must</i> observe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Suggestive Methods to Pursue</span></h4>

<p>To discipline the power of observation, begin consciously <i>to
see</i> and then immediately to test your own remembrance of
what you see. See slowly, see surely. Be sure you have seen
correctly. There is so much uncertainty in all of our mental
processes. If it is a pile of books you are seeing, be sure,
positive, that there are eleven. Do not content yourself by
saying there are about ten or twelve and let it go at that. Note
their size, color of their bindings, and, if possible, note each
title.</p>

<p>There are some librarians who seldom forget a book after
once seeing it, and can tell not only its appearance, but its place
on the book shelves, and the appearance of its neighbors on
either side. This is one of the qualifications of an efficient
library assistant. What is true of the librarian is likewise true
of other people. What makes the difference between an efficient
clerk in a book-store and one who is merely passable?
It is this power of observation and memory which makes his
knowledge of books held in stock reliable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_718"></a>[718]</span></p>

<p>Let us continue our suggestions. In looking over a landscape
be definite in your seeing. Be sure that the river is to
the left, and not to the right; that a certain tree is a sycamore,
and not a poplar; that the green on the hillside is the young,
fresh green of the dawn of the spring, rather than the richer
green of the summer. What is it that makes the landscape
artist? His power to portray depends upon his ability to discern
and observe. The poet and orator do the same, but they
make their pictures with words and phrases instead of pigments
and canvas.</p>

<p>In seeing anything, get hold of every fact possible—size,
position, color, relative importance, and, then, before you conclude
your observations, close your eyes and reconstruct the
scene mentally. Do this over and over again, until you add
and add to your mental picture things you had before failed
to see. Do not merely catalogue mentally, but see everything
in its own place, in full detail, and in its relation to every
other thing. A comparatively short period of this kind of discipline
will enable you to do things that will not only astound
your friends, but will be a source of infinite pleasure and, if
used intelligently in your business or profession, profit to
yourself.</p>

<p>The same principle applies in reading. Read slowly. Be
sure you understand. Grasp every idea thoroughly. To do
this you must learn to picture mentally. You should compel
yourself to make a mental picture of every scene described.
You are reading Victor Hugo’s “Les Miserables.” You come
to his incomparable description of the battle of Waterloo. He
tells us at the very commencement that it was the rain that
gained the victory at Waterloo. Observation and reflection
on Hugo’s part made it possible for him to make this declaration.
Carefully observe this statement and what follows.</p>

<p>Picture that great plain, the undulating sweep of ground.
Place the two armies, and then see the attack begin on Hougomont.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_719"></a>[719]</span>
Watch the changing scene with your mental eyes. Follow
Hugo as he describes the general confusion from noon
until four o’clock in the afternoon. Now prepare yourself for
a great picture of a tremendous day. See Wellington’s disposal
of his troops on the farther side of a long hill, on the
crest of which was a deep trench caused by a road whose ruts
during the centuries had worn down into the earth ten, twenty
or more feet. On the near side of this hill Napoleon’s cavalry
are ascending—three thousand five hundred of them, colossal
men on colossal horses. On, up, they sweep. They
seem as irresistible as the passing cyclone. Just as they reach
the crest, to their horror they discover this trench between
themselves and the English. Let Hugo’s own words now complete
the picture for you:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected,
yawning, directly under the horses’ feet, two fathoms deep between
its double slopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third
pushed on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on
their haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming
the riders; and there being no means of retreat,—the whole
column being no longer anything more than a projectile,—the force
which had been acquired to crush the English crushed the French;
the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders
rolled pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in
this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest marched
over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade fell
into that abyss.</p>

</div>

<p>Take an illustration from the American novel—“Ramona.”
Get a real picture in your mind of the appearance of the country.
See the sheep with their lambs in the fields under the
trees. Determine what size, shape, and color these trees are.
Picture Juan Can, the foreman or <i>major-domo</i>, listen to his
voice, so that you can definitely sense what kind of impression
it makes upon your mental ear. Do the same with the Señora
Moreno. Can you see that mustard-field described by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_720"></a>[720]</span>
author, where Ramona goes out to meet the good Father Salvierderra?
Have you got a picture in your mind of Ramona,
and the father, and how they met, and how they returned to
Camulos together? Picture, <i>picture</i>, <span class="smcap">picture</span>, mentally, until
every scene, every landscape, every character is vividly before
you.</p>

<p>This was the method followed by Macaulay, whose memory
was so phenomenal that Sydney Smith called him “an encyclopedia
in breeches,” and who used to say that he owed much of
his memory power to the discipline he used to give himself in
mental picturing. He never read in a hurry. He always allowed
himself time enough vividly to bring the scene before his
mental vision, and once done, with him, it was ready to be
recalled at any time.</p>

<p>Joaquin Miller used to say that he even pictured abstract
ideas. If, for instance, he was thinking of the abstract quality
of coldness, he would make a picture of some one suffering
from cold, or some wintry landscape.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">It Is Difficult to Observe Properly</span></h4>

<p>By this time, if you have faithfully followed these instructions
about observation, you will have discovered that the mere
observation of unrelated facts amounts to very little. You will
begin to see that no observation of the mind is simple. While
you are observing, you are naturally doing something else, for
you are classifying facts, seeing their relation one to another,
recognizing similarities or differences, contrasts and harmonies.
The mind works as a whole, not the memory separately, nor
the judgment by itself. Each part is dependent upon each
other part: they overlap one another; the operations of one
faculty imply the operations of all the other faculties. It is
for this reason that the student must seek to discipline each
apparently isolated faculty of the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_721"></a>[721]</span></p>

<p>In observing, it is not enough mentally to picture what you
read. You must go even more into detail than that. You
must observe <i>words</i>. Did you ever read “Martin Eden,” that
wonderful study in mental development and self-analysis,
written by Jack London, revealing in retrospect his own mental
processes? It will more than pay you for the trouble of reading.
Follow and practice what he therein describes. Words
are things, but they are things only when you know them so
intimately that they bring real concept to your mind the moment
you see them. It is not enough that you can pronounce
a word properly—that you <i>seem</i> to know it. Each word must
<i>mean</i> something to you, and that something must be <i>definite</i>,
so definite that no other can mean exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>One of the greatest dialectitians of our day was Monsignore
Capel, the private confessor of Pope Leo XIII. Even in extemporaneous
speech every word he used was the right word.
No other word would have done just as well. He was once
asked how he gained his power over words, and he replied to
the effect that when he was a lad he had several tutors. One
only, however, was a real and thorough teacher. He said:
“My first day with him I shall never forget. He gave me a
lesson in Cæsar, and then sent me away with six lines, which
I was to translate and bring to him in the afternoon. That
seemed easy. When I went to recite my lesson I followed my
usual wont—gave a free and easy translation, which may have
contained the sense of the original, or may not. He heard me
through without a word. Then he began a dissection of my
method of translation that made my hair stand on end, every
drop of my blood tingle, every faculty of my brain respond,
every power of my soul awaken to a sense of the hitherto untold,
undreamed of, unbounded capacities of words. That man
was a genius in quickening a lad’s dormant faculties into living,
driving, whipping forces for good. He took each word of the
original and demanded that I find its equivalent in English, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_722"></a>[722]</span>
he showed me how to do it. I must never take to him an English
word whose original parentage I could not trace. I must
know all its mutations and their whys and wherefores. There
could be no such thing as a <i>free</i> translation. It was either a
strictly literal <i>translation</i> or <i>my version</i>, lazy or otherwise, in
another language from that in which the author had written.
From that day on, I began the study of words. I learned how
to trace the history of words; the changes that had come into
their meanings, and my teacher helped me to do it during the
whole of the time I was in his hands. To him I owe whatever
power I possess to-day.”</p>

<p>Read Trench’s book on words and then study John Ruskin’s
“Sesame and Lilies.” Get hold of all the modern books on the
subject. Read Shelley, Keats, George Sterling, Browning,
Swinburne—any author who has great felicity of phrase, rare
delicacy of expression, and seek to discover his secret, and
you will be amazed at the potent force of words. For, of
course, while words themselves are to be studied, it is in their
relation one to another when put into sentences that their
power, sweetness, beauty, charm, and music lie.</p>

<p>And here we come to the real work of observing. All else
is preparatory to grasping the <i>idea</i> of the author. In his idea
lies his inspiration. The words he uses may be good, medium,
or indifferent, but if we grasp his idea, his high, intellectual
and spiritual conception and aspirations, we have gained the
chief thing. Words are a wonderful help in this. His power
to arrange them, to give them new settings, new and richer
cadences, will not fail to quicken our own intellect to readier
and keener appreciation of his thought. Hence words should
be deeply, attentively and earnestly studied by all authors and
speakers in order that they may be able to arrange them in this
masterly fashion. For this personal arrangement of words
and phrases, this flow and rhythm, is that marvelous thing we
call style. Several times in “Martin Eden” Jack London refers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_723"></a>[723]</span>
to this. He has his rude hero who is brought out of the
streets, influenced by the love he feels for the heroine, determine
to educate himself. He studies and begins to write.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He read to her a story [one of his own compositions], one that he
flattered himself was among his very best. He called it “The Wine
of Life,” and the wine of it, that had stolen into his brain when he
wrote it, stole into his brain now as he read it. There was a certain
magic in the original conception, and he adorned it with more magic
and phrase and touch. All the old fire was reborn in him and he was
swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of
it. But it was not so with Ruth. Her trained ear detected the weaknesses
and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro, and she was
instantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm tripped and faltered.
She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise, except when it became too
pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its
amateurishness.</p>

<p>Just before this he said to her: “I hope I am learning to talk, there
seems to be so much in me I want to say. But it is all so big. I can’t
find ways to say what is really in me. Sometimes it seems to me that
all the world, all life, everything, had taken up residence inside of me
and was clamoring for me to be spokesman. I feel—oh, I can’t describe
it—I feel the bigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a
child. It is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech,
written or spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute
itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation. It is a lordly
task. See, I bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in
through my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and
fancies. It is a breath of the Universe I have breathed. I know song
and laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and see
visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass,
and I would like to tell them to you, to the world. But how can I?
My tongue is tied. I have tried, by the spoken word, just now, to
describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass. But I
have not succeeded. I have no more than hinted in awkward speech.
My words seem gibberish to me, and yet I am stifled with desire to
tell.”</p>

<p>That was her final judgment on the story as a whole—amateurish,
though she did not tell him so. Instead, when he had done, she
pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_724"></a>[724]</span></p>

<p>But he was disappointed. Her criticism was just. He acknowledged
that, but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her
for the purpose of schoolroom correction. The details did not matter.
They could take care of themselves. He could mend them, he could
learn to mend them. Out of life he had captured something big and
attempted to imprison it in the story. It was the big thing out of life
that he had read to her, not sentence structure and semicolons. He
wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his, that he had
seen with his own eyes, grappled with his own brain, and placed there
on the pages with his own hands in printed words. Well, he had
failed, was his secret decision. Perhaps the editors were right. He
had felt the big thing, but he had failed to transmute it. He concealed
his disappointment, and joined so easily with her in her criticism
that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a
strong undercurrent of disagreement.</p>

</div>

<p>Later he enlarges upon this, and also relates how he gained
his mastery:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On the looking-glass were lists of definitions and pronunciations;
when shaving, or dressing, or combing his hair, he conned these lists
over. Similar lists were on the wall over the oil-stove, and they were
similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or washing dishes.
New lists continually displaced the old ones. Every strange or partly
familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,
and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed
and pinned to the wall or looking-glass. He even carried them in his
pockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while
waiting in butcher-shop or grocery to be served.</p>

<p>He went farther in the matter. Reading the works of men who had
arrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the
tricks by which they had been achieved—the tricks of narrative, of
exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams;
and of all these he made lists for study. He did not ape. He sought
principles. He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till
out of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the
general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for
new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and
appraise them properly. In similar manner he collected lists of strong
phrases, the phrases of living languages, phrases that bit like acid and
scorched like flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_725"></a>[725]</span>
the midst of the arid desert of common speech. He sought always for
the principle that lay behind and beneath. He wanted to know how
the thing was done; after that he could do it for himself. He was not
content with the fair face of the beauty. He dissected beauty in his
crowded little bedroom laboratory, where cooking smells alternated
with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe; and, having dissected and
learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to create
beauty itself.</p>

</div>

<p>This latter quotation shows us how Jack London mastered a
knowledge of that subtle thing called “style.” Every student
of English literature knows there are vast differences between
the writings of Johnson and Carlyle, DeQuincey and Coleridge,
Ruskin and Newman, Browning and Tennyson. Yet
each uses the English language and possibly it might be found
that the vocabulary of each was not very different from that
of the other. Then wherein lies the difference? It is in that
marvelous personal quality, that individuality expressed in its
use of words, that we call style, that the difference lies.</p>

<p>To aid your memory, study and observe <i>styles</i>. Ever be on
the alert to discover why an author appeals to you. In reading
Bret Harte ask yourself why his appeal is so different
from that of Sir Walter Scott, Browning from Longfellow,
Whitman from Swinburne, Pope from Sterling.</p>

<p>Observation also applies to hearing as well as seeing. How
do you hear? Carefully, definitely, specifically, or indifferently,
generally? Have you ever sought to disentangle the
roar of noises you can hear in the city’s streets? At first it is
a dull confusion of sound that comes as one great, indistinguishable
roar. Listen! Observe, and you will soon be able
to distinguish the clatter of hoofs from the creak of the car-wheels;
the whistle of the traffic-officer from the cry of the
newsboy, or the honking of automobile-horns from the clang
of street-car gongs.</p>

<p>Most people think that only a highly trained musician should
be able to distinguish the various instruments as they are played<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_726"></a>[726]</span>
in a band or an orchestra, but any well-trained observer should
be able to differentiate between the instruments if he so desires.
And this brings us to a very striking discovery that we
should not overlook; namely, that the powers of observation
should be under the personal control of the individual. For
instance, if he desires to observe the effect of the music of an
orchestra of a hundred pieces <i>as a whole</i>, he should be able to
do so. He should likewise be able to hear the different instruments,
either alone, or in their relation one to another. The
power to do this is one of the qualifications of a great conductor.
His faculties of observation are highly developed, or
are naturally acute in this regard; hence, when combined with
other leadership qualities, he becomes a great director.</p>

<p>As applied to hearing a speech, lecture, or sermon, how
shall one observe? Exactly the same as one observes in reading—by
concentration of attention, seeing details, visualizing
or mentally picturing every scene; listening to the speaker’s
choice of words; his power to make euphonic grouping not only
for the sweetness of sound, but for their potency as well.</p>

<p>Hard work, this observing, is it not? It is intensive and
perpetual. The athlete must keep in training so long as he
desires physically to excel; so with the student or scholar. He
must not lag, must not cease in his efforts, or he will lose his
place or power. The will must be evoked to aid in such concentration
of effort. The desire must be more fully excited,
aroused, enthused, or the will will not respond. How many
people go to church, to hear a lecture, an address, with the
determination strong within them to allow nothing to interfere
with their observing to the full what is said by the speaker?
Note the turning around as late-comers take their places.
Watch how easily the major part of an audience’s attention
can be diverted. It is pitiable and even ludicrous were it not
so lamentable, because it reveals that in the training of our
youth strict attention has not been demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_727"></a>[727]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Develop the Power of Reflection</span></h4>

<p>We now come to the second part of Professor Stokes’s rule—<i>Reflect</i>.
This word is made up of two Latin words <i>re</i>, back
or again, and <i>flecto</i>, to bend or turn. The meaning is thus
made clear. By observation through one or more of our
senses we perceive things; mental impressions are secured;
these are now to be bent or turned so that we can see them
again, but the process is to be purely mental. Reflection in
itself implies recognition or memory, for without memory
there could be nothing upon which to reflect. Every normal
human being has the power to bend again, to turn back, and
over and over again the impressions he has received through
observation. Hence reflect continuously upon that which you
wish to remember. Go over it in every possible way. Dwell
upon it, let it develop within you until you are as familiar with
every possible phase, detail, change, enlargement in it, as a
fond mother is with the face of her precious baby. As you
reflect, be sure your mind is not playing you false. Refresh
it by referring to the original again and again if possible. In
this way you deepen the original impressions, make them more
lasting, more secure. Then, too, as you look upon a subject
again—reflect upon it—you get new angles of vision. This
enlarges your conception and provokes original thought. For
instance: Newton observed an apple fall. There we have a
simple fact of observation. He began to reflect upon this fact.
As he did so, fresh thought upon the fact leaped into his mind
and in due time the theory of gravitation was born.</p>

<p>Centuries ago men observed the fact that when a string of
any kind was pulled tight and struck upon it gave forth a musical
sound. In due time a man or many men in succession
reflected upon this fact, and the guitar, the banjo, the ukulele,
the violin and the piano were invented, born of the processes
of observation and reflection. This is everywhere seen in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_728"></a>[728]</span>
fields where the inventive genius of man is at play. It was
John Dolland who observed that glass made of different kinds,
or different properties of sand and silica, etc., had a different
color, and produced a different effect when used in a sidereal
telescope. He reflected upon this fact. This led him to experiment,
and by and by he discovered that when he placed
lenses together, one concave and the other convex, and one of
crown and the other of flint glass, a telescope was made that
eliminated the extra and confusing images of the object gazed
upon, hitherto found on the outer rim of all telescopes. In
other words, the achromatic telescope was born—one of the
greatest helps to astronomical science—born of many careful
observations and long-continued reflections.</p>

<p>Another case in point is that of Franklin, who saw the lightning
in the clouds—a simple act of observation. He began to
reflect upon his observation. His reflections suggested something.
He sent up a kite to find out if there was any possibility
of tapping that inexhaustible reservoir of electricity in
the heavens. Our use to-day of the telegraph, telephone,
wireless, electric light, electric power in the thousand and one
ways it is made to do service to mankind is the result of those
acts of observation and reflection. The same is true with
Luther Burbank, who looked more closely, more attentively,
with greater concentration, upon flowers, vegetables, plants,
trees, than most men, observed that extra fine potatoes resulted
when the flowers of the largest and best potatoes were cross-pollinated.
He reflected upon this fact. The results have
astounded the world in the development of improved and even
new varieties of useful and beautiful growths. Also Darwin’s
observations, confirmed by those of thousands of others, duly
reflected upon, enabled him to write his “Origin of Species”;
and when Herbert Spencer read (observed) that book and
reflected upon it, and others cognate with it, he formulated his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_729"></a>[729]</span>
“Synthetic Philosophy,” which absolutely changed the current
of the thought of the world.</p>

<p>So it is with all sciences, all theories, all working hypotheses,
all steps toward complete knowledge. They, each and all, invariably
and unalterably depend upon the two powers of observation
and reflection. There are no discoveries, no inventions,
without these two mental operations. Hence is it not apparent
that no memory student can <i>over</i>-estimate their importance?
For, here is a fact that observation has revealed and reflection
and experience confirmed; namely, that he who has carefully
observed the most facts is the best prepared to reflect profitably.
Or to put it in still another way; no one can properly,
completely and successfully reflect unless his mind is stored
with many facts accurately and minutely observed. How
could Carlyle have written his wonderful “Heroes and Hero
Worship” unless he had carefully observed, through his reading,
the effect of a great man’s actions upon millions of his fellowmen?
His “Cromwell” and “French Revolution” still more
fully reflect the wealth of his stored facts (observations) and
the result of his constantly turning them over again and again
(reflection) in his powerful, logical and imaginative mind.
Helen Hunt Jackson’s “Ramona” is a similar result of powerful
observation of the California Indians and sympathetic and
clear-headed reflection, as was also Harriet Beecher Stowe’s
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Hence, <i>Observe</i>, <i>Reflect</i>, with greater
and increasingly greater care.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Thought-Linking</span></h4>

<p>We now come to Stokes’s third requirement—“Link thought
with thought.” Few things are seen isolated from other
things. Indeed, unless one deliberately shuts out—inhibits—his
observing faculties, it is impossible for him to see one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_730"></a>[730]</span>
thing alone. Even the solitary star is seen in relation to the
sky, and the solitary vessel, as it moves, in relation to the ever-changing
surface of the deep. And it is this natural relationship
of one idea to another—and its conscious recognition at
the time of observation, or later, during reflection, that one’s
memory is aided. This is what psychologists have always
called “the law of the association of ideas.” It is a natural
law, which even a child unconsciously recognizes. The baby
subconsciously or instinctively knows that food and its pleasant
sensations of comfort are associated with its mother’s
breast. Star and sky, sea and ship, automobile and swift
travel, gun and war, cyclone and disaster, are instances of natural
and simple association that all people recognize.</p>

<p>In the cultivation, discipline, strengthening of the powers of
the memory, this natural law can be made to render marvelous
service. For not only can man avail himself of faculties of
the mind unconsciously exercised, he has the additional power
of consciously directing their exercise. Just as our domestic
water systems are the result of the conscious direction of the
self-flowing water in the course we wish it to flow, so is the
enlarged power of our memories the result of the conscious and
purposeful direction of our observation, reflection, and thought-linking
to that end. Drawn from personal experience there
are five methods of thought-linking which have proved themselves
of great help. These are: First, <i>Incidental</i>. Second,
<i>Accidental</i>. Third, <i>Scientific</i>. Fourth, <i>Pictorial</i>. Fifth, <i>Constructive</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Incidental Method</span></h4>

<p>The events, the incidents, of the day occur in a natural order:
one follows another. The days of the week with their respective
incidents follow in natural sequence. A full recognition
of this fact is of far greater help to the memory than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_731"></a>[731]</span>
one would believe on first thought. Many a man has been
able to recall a particularly important event by going back,
step by step, incident by incident, over the occurrences of the
day. It is related of Thurlow Weed, the eminent statesman,
that, when he entered political life, he had so poor and
wretched a memory that it was his bane. He determined to
improve it, and, realizing the importance of observation and
reflection, he decided upon the following method: As the incidents
of the day followed each other, in natural sequence, he
would consciously note <i>how</i> they followed. Then at the close
of the day he sat down with his wife, and relating the incidents
exactly in the order they occurred, he would review the events
of the day, even to the most trivial and inconsequential act.
At other times he would relate the incidental order backwards.
It was not long before his memory so improved that he began
to be noted for it. Before he died, he had the reputation of
possessing a phenomenal memory. One will find this same
method a great help in seeking to recall a sermon, a lecture or
speech. There is a natural sequence in all well-thought-out
addresses, and the listener, carefully noting the change from
one thought to another—the progress of the address—will find
it aid his memory development wonderfully to take the last
thought given, say, and in reverse order, bring up the thoughts,
the ideas given. Then let the address be “incidentally” gone
over from the first thought to the second, the third, and so on
to the end. Thus it can be recalled and put away in the memory
securely for future use.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Accidental Method</span></h4>

<p>Another natural method is what may be termed accidental.
It is purely accidental that Pike’s Peak is 14,147 feet high, but
see how this fact enables you to fix the figures in your mind.
There are two fourteens and the last figure is half of fourteen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_732"></a>[732]</span>
namely, seven. It is a purely accidental fact that the two
Emperors of Germany died in 1888, but the fact that they did
die in that year, the one year in the whole century when the
three eights occur, indelibly fixes the date in mind. Again
the year 1666 might have passed by unnoticed were it not for
the fact that that was the date of the Great Fire in London.</p>

<p>Now let us see how this accidental association may fix a
relative date for many other important events. The Great
Fire purged the city of London of the horrors caused by the
Great Plague. This plague was made the basis for Eugene
Sue’s graphic novel, “The Wandering Jew.” Wherever he
went—so ran the legend—the plague followed as the result of
Christ’s curse. It was the Great Plague that brought into existence
the peculiar custom of all the Latin, as well as the
English, peoples exclaiming, “God bless you!” or its equivalent,
upon hearing one sneeze. The reason for the custom is that
sneezing was one of the first symptoms of the fearful plague,
and one, hearing his friend sneeze, immediately felt afraid he
was seized with the dread disease, and gave vent to this pious
exclamation. The custom persists to this day, but few know
its origin. This plague also brings to mind a noble example
of heroism that is worthy of enshrinement in every heart. It
was found by those who watched the progress of the plague
that it went from place to place, dying out here as soon as it
appeared elsewhere. It was this phenomenon that gave to
Eugene Sue the dramatic element in his novel, for it appeared
to the ignorant people of those days that the plague actually
followed the cursed Jew. A country pastor, an humble but
devoted and true servant of God, in a little Derbyshire village,
had observed this fact. Although isolation for contagious diseases
was not thought of by physicians at that time, this man
seemed to grasp the idea. He determined that if ever the disease
reached his village he would endeavor to isolate his people
from all others so that it would stop there and no longer continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_733"></a>[733]</span>
to slay its helpless victims. In due time the plague did
appear in his village. He had already aroused in his simple-minded
flock the spirit of true heroism, and they pledged themselves
to second his endeavors. Food was brought from a
near-by town and deposited near a watering-trough, in which
a small stream was continually flowing. In this flowing water
the villagers placed the money in payment for their food supplies.
Thus there was no contact of peoples, no contamination.
The villagers kept to themselves, no one going away and
no one coming in. The result was that in a very short time the
plague was stayed, and Europe breathed a great sigh of relief,
attributing its cessation to the goodness of God, when we now
know it was owing to the self-sacrificing wisdom of men.</p>

<p>But we are not yet through with our associations with the
accidental date of 1666. The most remarkable account we
have of the Great Plague is Daniel DeFoe’s “Journal of the
Plague,” which for many years was regarded as the genuine
diary of an eye-witness. As DeFoe, however, was not born
until 1661, five years before the plague, he could have had but
the faintest and most childish remembrances of that dread
event. But it was he who wrote the world-famous, ever-enjoyable
“Robinson Crusoe.” This appeared in 1719, and,
while the association of this date with that of 1666 is remote,
it does approximately fix the date of the appearance of that
masterpiece.</p>

<p>Another literary masterpiece appeared, however, much
nearer the time of the plague. That was John Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s
Progress,” which was written in Bedford Jail during
the actual year of the plague and fire.</p>

<p>One of the greatest lawyers of England was Sir Matthew
Hale, and it is a help to fix approximately the time he was on
the bench when we recall that it was he who sentenced John
Bunyan to the twelve years’ confinement that gave to the world
his “Pilgrim’s Progress.” On the other hand, Hale was a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_734"></a>[734]</span>
personal friend of Richard Baxter, who, at about the same
time, wrote the well known “Saints’ Everlasting Rest.” Here,
then, hung on to this accidental peg of the year 1666, we find
the following facts: First, the Great Fire; second, the Great
Plague; third, Eugene Sue’s novel “The Wandering Jew;”
fourth, the custom of saying “God bless you;” fifth, the heroism
of the Derbyshire villagers that stopped the plague; sixth

<p>Every novelist uses this law of accidental association, for
it is habitually used by every class of people. Who is there
who does not recall certain events because they happened on
days when other and perhaps more important events occurred
which fixed the date in the mind? For instance, if an event
occurred on the day of her first child’s birth, and the mother
was aware of it, you may rest fully assured she would have
no trouble recalling the date of the event. Its accidental association
will guarantee its remembrance.</p>

<p>Lawyers use this law constantly in seeking to extract evidences
from their witnesses. The dates of certain events are
surely fixed in the mind. Other events, less securely remembered,
occurred at, or about, the same time. The association
once clearly established, the memory invariably responds.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Scientific Method</span></h4>

<p>This method is merely a phase of reflection, for during that
process one naturally classifies his ideas, received through
observation. As David Pryde says in his “How to Read”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>See every fact and group of facts as clearly and distinctly as you
can; ascertain the fact in your past experience to which it bears a
likeness or relation, and then associate it with that fact. And this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_735"></a>[735]</span>
rule can be applied in almost every case. Take as an example that
most difficult of all efforts, namely, the beginning of a new study,
where all the details are strange. All that you have to do is to begin
with those details that can be associated with your past experience.
In science, begin with the specimens with which you are already familiar,
and group around them as many other specimens as you can. In
history and geography, commence with the facts relating to the places
and scenes which you actually know. And in foreign languages, start
with the words and phrases for the most familiar objects and incidents
of every-day life. In this way you will give all your mind a clear and
safe foundation in your own experience.... The mind cannot master
many disconnected details. It becomes perplexed and then helpless. It
must generalize these details. It must arrange them into groups, according
to the three laws of association—resemblance, contiguity, and cause
and effect. This, it will be granted at once, must be the method in
all rigidly systematic studies, such as the sciences, history, biography,
and politics. But it is valuable to ordinary people as well to know
that the same plan can be used in all kinds of descriptions. Every collection
of details can be arranged in groups in such a way that they
can be clearly understood and remembered. The following is the manner
in which this can be done: In studying any interesting scene, let
your mind look carefully at all the details. You will then become conscious
of one or more definite effects or strong impressions that have
been made upon you. Discover what these impressions are. Then
group and describe in order the details which tend to produce each of
the impressions. You will then find that you have comprised in your
description all the important details of the scene. As an instance, let
us suppose a writer is out in the country on a morning toward the end
of May, and wishes to describe the multitudinous objects which delight
his senses. First of all, he ascertains that the general impressions as
produced on his mind by the summer landscape are the ideas of <i>luxuriance</i>,
<i>brightness</i> and <i>joy</i>. He then proceeds to describe in these
groups the details which produce these impressions. He first takes up
the <i>luxuriant</i> features, the springing crops of grain completely hiding
the red soil; the rich, living carpet of grass and flowers covering the
meadows; the hedge-rows on each side of the way, in their bright summer
green; the trees bending gracefully under the full weight of their
foliage; and the wild plants, those waifs of nature, flourishing everywhere,
smothering the woodland brook, filling up each scar and crevice
in the rock, and making a rich fringe along the side of every highway
and footpath. He then descants upon the brightness of the <i>landscape</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_736"></a>[736]</span>
the golden sunshine; the pearly dew-drops hanging on the tips of every
blade of grass, and sparkling in the morning rays; the clusters of
daisies dappling the pasture-land; the dandelion glowing under the very
foot of the traveler; the chestnut trees, like great candelabra, stuck all
over with white lights, lighting up the woodlands; and lilacs, laburnums,
and hawthorne in full flower, making the farmer’s garden one
mass of variegated blossom. And last of all, he can dwell upon the
<i>joy</i> that is abroad on the face of the earth: the little birds so full of
one feeling that they can only trill it forth in the same delicious monotone;
the lark bounding into the air, as if eager and quivering to proclaim
his joy to the whole world; the bee humming his satisfaction
as he revels among the flowers; and the myriads of insects floating in
the air and poising and darting with drowsy buzz through the floods
of golden sunshine. Thus we see that, by this habit of generalizing,
the mind can grasp the details of almost any scene.</p>

<p>This desire to unify knowledge, to see unity in variety, is one of the
most noted characteristics of great men in all departures of learning.
Scientific men in the present day are eager to resolve all the phenomena
of nature into force or energy. The history of philosophy, too, is in a
great measure, taken up with attempts to prove that being and knowing
are identical. Emerson can find no better definition of genius
than that it is intellect constructive. Perhaps, he says, if we should
meet Shakspere, we should not be conscious of any great inferiority,
but of a great equality, only that he possesses a great skill of using—of
classifying—his facts, which we lacked.</p>

</div>

<p>Herbert Spencer was a master at the classification of facts.
By the classification of all the known languages of the world,
the scientists are seeking to find out accurately, as never before,
the relationships of mankind. Men have been writing
the different languages of widely diverse people for centuries,
but never before has an attempt been made on so vast a scale
to bring all this isolated knowledge to bear upon the solution
of one great question—the origin of the human race. All scientific
knowledge is based upon the association of isolated and
detached facts. These are then reflected upon, and, finally,
theories begin to form themselves in the mind of the student,
the philosopher. He then brings his facts and theories into
close relationship and sees whether they “fit.” If he is assured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_737"></a>[737]</span>
that they do, he presents his thought to the world, and,
according to its reasonableness, it is received or rejected.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Pictorial Method</span></h4>

<p>Most children make mental pictures with great ease, but,
unfortunately, as they grow older, they allow this faculty to
lose its power by disuse. In the cultivation and use of the
memory, however, it can be of the greatest possible help. All
books of travel and description, all novels, all history, are
made up of a series of word pictures. Do not be content
merely to <i>read</i> the <i>words</i> of these pictures. Go further!
Actually <i>picture each scene in your imagination</i> and you will
thus materially aid your original power of observation. Let
your pictures be definite, positive, explicit as to details, for the
more careful you are in making a picture real to your mind,
the easier it will be recalled.</p>

<p>Now, if you desire to recall the whole course of a book,
you will find these vividly-made mental pictures have a natural
order of sequence, and one will recall the next following, and
so on. There is great joy in learning to make pictorial
thought-links, and then in the ability they give to the memory
to recall them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Methods of Constructive Thought-Linking</span></h4>

<p>We now come to the active making of artificial links as aids
to the memory where none naturally appear. A thought-link
of this type is the generally known doggerel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thirty days hath September,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">April, June and November,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the rest have thirty-one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save February which alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>Has twenty-eight, and one day more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We add to it one year in four.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_738"></a>[738]</span></p>

<p>In like manner how do we remember the order of the prime
colors? Few there are who do not know the coined word,
made from the initial letters of Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,
Yellow, Orange, Red—Vibgyor. Again, the student of geology,
who forgets the order of his great epochs or eras, might recall
them by formulating a sentence that presents the initial letters
of the names of these epochs. Thus, “Careful men pay easily,”
suggests Cenozoic, Mesozoic, Paleozoic, Eozoic. Of
course no one of common sense presumes to assert that these
constructive thought-links are any other than crutches, footbridges
over streams too wide to stride or jump unaided. They
should frankly be recognized as such, and only reverted to in
case of necessity, or as a last resort. But it is equally foolish
in view of the testimony of their almost universal usage and
helpfulness, to deny that they are an aid to most memories.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Think of the Impressions</span></h4>

<p>To “think of the impressions.” This is the final admonition
of Stokes’s golden rule of memory. One word conveys his
idea—review. The things to be remembered must be thought
over. They must be re-collected—again collected. You will
thus re-observe them, re-reflect upon them, re-strengthen your
original mental impressions and the ideas that have grown
around them. Experience demonstrates that all memory impressions
are lasting. One may have forgotten something for
twenty, thirty, forty years, when suddenly a chance word,
sound, sight, or even odor, will recall it with an intensity and
reality that are startling. All works on mental philosophy give
illustrations of this asserted fact. The practical need of all
men, however, is to cultivate the ability to call up mental impressions
at will.</p>

<p>Ready recollection is the great desideratum. Hidden knowledge
is of slight use. It is as if one had a fortune stored away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_739"></a>[739]</span>
in some hidden dungeon, carefully locked up, but he had lost
the key. Availability, readiness, promptness are essentials to
efficiency. The hat-boy at the hotel dining-room would be
useless did his memory not act promptly, instantly. To-morrow
will not do. Now is the accepted time.</p>

<p>This efficient, prompt, responsive memory is the one you
need and desire. It is worth striving for. The prospector
wanders over the mountains, canyons, deserts, for years, seeking
the precious ore in most unlikely places. He is always
buoyed up with the hope, some day, of striking it rich. Are
you as earnest in your desire for memory development as he?
If so, careful, systematic, daily exercise of the various faculties
of the mind and memory will give to you this golden possession.
Reread here what has been quoted earlier from David
Pryde’s “What Books to Read and How to Read.” The hints
therein contained are worth their weight in gold to the really
earnest student. But rest assured of this: If you would
have a good memory, you must work for it. Give your whole
attention to whatever you read or hear. Concentrate. Compare
the parts of the composition with the whole. Seek its
excellencies, study its deficiencies. Reflect upon it from every
angle. Write out in your own language the facts, or the ideas
of what you have heard or read. Then use daily what you
have gained. Knowledge stored away in the mind is not only
useless, it is positively injurious. <i>Use is the law of life.</i> Give
your knowledge, your ideas, your reflections away. Tell them
to your intimates, your friends. Write them to your correspondents.
For the more you give the more you will find you
have. There is a giving that increases and a withholding that
impoverishes, and in nothing is this more apparent than in the
giving of the riches of the mind or memory. Each time one
recites a well-liked poem for the benefit and blessing of others,
the more firmly he fixes it in his own mind. “There is that
which scattereth, and yet increaseth.” In the scattering of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_740"></a>[740]</span>
your gems of mind and heart, you are increasing your own
store.</p>

<p>Not only give freely, but give often. The daily use of what
you have gained is an advantage. Avail yourself of every
reasonable opportunity to use your newly acquired powers, and
your newly acquired knowledge. Let me repeat, <i>use is the law
of life</i>. To learn something new daily is a good motto, but to
use what you have learned is even better. You gain ease of
recollection by daily exercising the faculty of recollection.
And if your memory balks, refuses to act, compel it to obey
you. If you make a demand upon it and it fails to respond—you
cannot remember—do not let the matter go by. Demand
of the memory that it bring back that which you require.
Keep the need before you.</p>

<p>In this constant, persistent, cheerful, willing use of the memory
lies great happiness and content. “It is more blessed to
give than to receive.” The more, in reason, the athlete uses
his muscles the stronger they become. And think of the radiant
joy that is the natural accompaniment of a healthy, vigorous
body. What constant pleasure is his who calls upon a
physical body which readily and willingly responds! Equally
so is it with the memory and all the mind. Activity keeps it
in health. In this glorious condition it readily responds to all
calls, it is radiantly alive, and I know of no joy greater that
can be given to man than that in body, mind, and soul he is a
radiating center of activity, receiving and giving on every hand.</p>

<p>In conclusion, here are a few practical words upon the other
side of the question, on forgetting, for there is a forgetting that
is of great help to the power of remembering. Fix these precepts
firmly in your mind:</p>

<p>Forget evil imaginations.</p>

<p>Forget the slander you have heard.</p>

<p>Forget the meanness of small souls.</p>

<p>Forget the faults of your friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_741"></a>[741]</span></p>

<p>Forget the injuries done you by your enemies.</p>

<p>Forget the misunderstandings of yesterday.</p>

<p>Forget all malice, all fault-finding, all injuries, all hardness,
all unlovely and distressing things.</p>

<p>Start out every day with a clean sheet. Remember only the
sweet, beautiful and lovely things, and you will thus be as a
human sun of righteousness, with healing in your rays.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Mr. Miller gives the following interesting note to the above poem:</p>

<p>“We had been moving West and West from my birth, at Liberty, Union
County, Indiana, November 10, 1841 or 1842 (the Bible was burned and we don’t
know which year), and now were in the woods of the Miami Indian Reserve. My
first recollection is of starting up from the trundle-bed with my two little brothers
and looking out one night at father and mother at work burning brush-heaps,
which threw a lurid flare against the greased paper window. Late that autumn I
was measured for my first shoes, and Papa led me to his school. Then a strange
old woman came, and there was mystery and a smell of mint, and one night, as
we three little ones were hurried away through the woods to a neighbor’s, she was
very cross. We three came back alone in the cold, early morning. There was a
little snow, rabbit tracks in the trail, and some quail ran hastily from cover to
cover. We three little ones were all alone and silent, so silent. We knew nothing,
nothing at all, and yet we knew, intuitively, all; but truly the divine mystery
of mother nature, God’s relegation of His last great work to woman, her
partnership with Him in creation—not one of us had ever dreamed of. Yet we
three little lads huddled up in a knot near the ice-hung eaves of the log cabin outside
the corner where mother’s bed stood and—did the new baby hear her silent
and awed little brothers? Did she feel them, outside there, huddled close together
in the cold and snow, listening, listening? For lo! a little baby cry came through
the cabin wall; and then we all rushed around the corner of the cabin, jerked the
latch and all three in a heap tumbled up into the bed and peered down into the
little pink face against mother’s breast. Gentle, gentle, how more than ever gentle
were we all six now in that little log cabin. Papa doing everything so gently,
saying nothing, only doing, doing. And ever so and always toward the West, till
1852, when he had touched the sea of seas, and could go no farther. And so gentle
always! Can you conceive how gentle? Seventy-two years he led and lived
in the wilderness and yet never fired or even laid hand to a gun.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> There is a Scandinavian legend that Siegfried, the “Viking,” feeling that he
was at the point of death, caused himself to be placed on the deck of his ship;
the sails were hoisted, the vessel set on fire, and in this manner he drifted out
to sea, alone, and finished his career.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> In the “days of old, the days of gold, and the days of ’49,” water was brought
from the Sierran heights in wooden viaducts, or “flumes,” to be used in the mines.
The fifth stanza refers to the process of hydraulic mining, where the water, projected
through huge nozzles (somewhat after the fashion used by fire-engines),
washed down the mountain-sides into the sluice-boxes where the dirt was washed
away and the gold retained. Now the flume’s waters are mainly diverted to purposes
of irrigation.</p>
